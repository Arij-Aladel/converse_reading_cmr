EOS what many people don't seem to understand are various factors that make the country mexico . mexico has a huge income inequality . this means that in a 120 million people country only 20-30 million hold all the wealth . these people live like your regular high / middle class society . this is why some areas look like parís in mexico city and some like somalia . this is also why brazil and mexico are the two countries behind the usa by number of private jets . https://corporatejetinvestor.com/articles/top-50-countries-number-business-jets-registered-343/ mexico having almost the double as the next country ( canada ) . while mexico may have 50 million people in poverty , 40 million have a buying power 4-5 times the rest . and between those people 2-5 million also have a buying power 5x the next 35 million . for example aeromexico , the mexican airline flag carrier is the latin american airline serving the most number of cities . ( nice airline btw , kinda expensive sometimes , part of skyteam and has new planes like the 787 ) thinking every mexican is a poor person looking for a job is not just delusional , its counter productive when having a debate on this topic . i've already had friends choose europe rather than traveling to the usa . another example is monterrey , this city is the latin american city with the most buying power . they routinely cross the border for shopping because it was very hip i suppose . this happens in many border cities [ for example in el paso mexican tourists account for almost billion in sales ] ( http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/local_news/article_bbb787cc-ecec-11e4-b6b5-3fbb35ffa014.html ) edit : example . this is the same city https://www.google.com.mx/maps/@19.4266597,-99.1683221,3a,75y,277.72h,91.54t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srYQxw3jGZeNeCARhFzUqWQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 https://www.google.com.mx/maps/@19.3901405,-99.0029796,3a,75y,49.62h,80.14t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sd9lYcgxO09GLswRCKvUnLQ!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo1.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3Dd9lYcgxO09GLswRCKvUnLQ%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D220.5%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656 living in mexico city is surreal sometime . in one place you have only hybrid taxis and ecobikes you can take and ride and leave for someone else to use them and in another you have microbuses and motorcycle gangs .	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS > canada has made it easier than ever to visit . in june 2016 , canadian prime minister justin trudeau announced visa-free travel for mexicans . since the policy was first announced , mexican tourism to canada has been skyrocketing , increasing 16 % , according to forwardkeys , a travel trend predicting firm . do you guys realize the only reason most of these mexicans are now coming to canada is because of the no visa requirement that the trudeau government introduced ? it's not trump . he might be a factor for a small percentage but definitely not for most of them . and guess what , they're going to revoke the no-visa bullshit policy soon because the amount of refugee claims coming out of mexican " visitors " is just absurd . refugee claims from mexico have gone up by 2500 % in the last two months ( according to irb data ) . it won't last . the only reason the no-visa requirement is still in place is because our government doesn't want to seem like trump # 2 . source : http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mexican-refugee-claims-canada-1.3927178 source : http://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/trudeau-message-to-refugees-1.4051008 source : http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=e&Mode=1&Parl=42&Ses=1&DocId=8689018 http://www.immigration.ca/major-increase-cbsa-detention-mexicans-canadian-border/ http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/mexican-refugees-canada-detained-1.4031389 http://globalnews.ca/news/3318767/cbsa-detaining-mexicans-2017/ edit : some of you aren't happy with my sources . my post indicates the rise of mexico refugee claimants and how the visa lift plays a role . it says nothing about pre-visa lift visitors ( 2016 ) . * * genuine visitors will have no problem visiting canada with or without a visa . * * the visa lift only helps those who are coming for other reasons . why did the government impose the visa requirement in 2009 in the first place ?	__UNDISCLOSED__

" party time " was their first album released in hi res audio format . since then , all of their future albums and singles are available in this format , making them one of the few artists who has all of their works released in hi res audio post 2014 ( their hi res audio recordings are at the format of flac 24bit 96khz ) . 6 . claris has held 2 live performance in january 5th 2014 and febuary 10 2017 , during which they completely made themselves unknown to public . 7 . in april 2017 , claris will move to sony's new label sacra music ( along with kalafina , lisa , luna haruna , egoist , sawanohiroyuki [ nzk ] , garnidelia , kana hanazawa , ayano mashiro , elisa , ... ) . the new label will focus more on global expansion ( events , concerts ) and releases in foreign countries , so expect them to get much more international recognition from now . 8 . not only does claris do anime's op and ed , they also do game's op too ! one of their song : again ( 15th single , fairy castle's 1st song ) , is used as the op for the game akiba's trip 9 . in april 26 2017 , they will release their 16th single " hitorigoto ( ヒトリゴト ) " , this song will be used as the upcoming eromanga-sensei's op 10 . the 4th studio album - fairy castle - marks karen's first studio album with claris . in the deluxe version of this album , they also re-recorded their 3 songs for the madoka series with karen singing alice's verse . they are : connect 2017 , luminous 2017 and colorful 2017 11 . claris's only ep : spring tracks - haru no uta - , consists of one original song ( hirahira hirara ) and 4 covers of sayonara memories ( supercell ) , sakura ( nirgilis ) , ashita , haru ga kitara ( takako matsu ) and akai sweet pea ( seiko matsuda ) 12 . claris has one compilation : claris : single best 1st , which consists of many of their well-known songs ( from both claris with alice and claris with karen ) . this is the only album where you can find alice's song in hi res audio format . 13 . they are my 2nd most favorite japanese artist , the 1st belongs to kalafina 14 . their latest studio album " fairy castle " has a limited edition , it comes with a deluxe edition of the album in cd and an animegraph which includes all of their illustration since their debut and the anime poster of their respective work , it retails for 5000 yen . i bought one from amazon.jp , the images of the package can be found [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/5YnQB ) 15 . claris uses illustrations to describe themselves and to remain their anonymity . clara is described with a crescent sign , whereas karen has a star sign and former alice has a sun sign . look carefully at their illustration and you can differentiate between them . 16 . claris has 3 albums and 1 single available in itunes stores us : birthday , party time , single best 1st and anemone . other countries vary ( e . g in vietnam where i live they also have fairy castle deluxe edition ) and here are my claris's recommendation of songs ( if you like their adult-voice , you definitely need to listen to them ) - irony , nexus , graduation , treasure , zutto ( from birthday , the latter 3 are really , really good , and zutto is probably the best song of that entire album ) - connect ( コネクト ) , luminous ( ルミナス ) and colorful ( カラフル ) ( both alice and karen's version are equally good ) - reunion , rainy day , hanabi , eternally ( from their 2nd album - second story ) - clear sky - drawing , restart , nemurihime ( 眠り姫 ) , dry flower ( ドライフラワー ) , time ( from their 3rd album - party time ) - prism , secret ( this song is really fun to listen to ! ) - ( from their single prism ) - anemone ( アネモネ ) , yumenoki ( from the anemone single ) - gravity , cloudy , awai omoi ( アワイ オモイ ) ( from the gravity single ) - clever ( from the clever single , in collaboration with garnidelia ) - again , collage ( from their 15th single again ) - hirahira hirara ( ひらひら ひらら ) * ( must listen , probably claris's best song until now ) * , kono i wa kyosuu ( このiは虚数 ) , mizuiro kurage ( 水色クラゲ ) , usotsuki ( ウソツキ ) , hologram ( ホログラム ) , recall ( from their album fairy castle ) - sayonara memories ( さよならメモリーズ ) and ashita , haru ga kitara ( 明日 、 春が来たら ) from their spring ep - border ( honorable mention ) , reflect and kite ( カイト ) from their single - border edit : add more songs and the 14th fact edit 2 : add 15th and 16th fact	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS i work at a kill animal shelter in australia , the no-kill shelters just transfer their dogs to here when they need to be euthanized ... so they still can ' technically ' be no kill . but we have a rigorous decision process anyway before it happens and the main reasons are if they have health issues or behavioural issues that can't be solved . EOS isn't that hard braking ? also a german here and i had no clue that there are specialised organisations , it's really sad . one would think it's a better idea to try fund raising rather than going down this road . people probably can't take that job for a long time ?	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS living in germany , i am sometimes annoyed at how you need a license for fucking everything ( including fishing , which you need to attend a 30 hour course to get the lifetime right to buy a fishing license every year ) . but honestly most of the time it makes sense and the rest of the society is better off for every dumb shit --> not <-- just being able to do whatever the fuck they want . unless it is driving as fast as his car can go , do not fuck with that . edit : forgot a key word ( not )	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS yup . there's one up north i've gotten many dogs from over the years . they take end-of-the-line dogs and cats . a lot of time it's older dogs , ones who have been abused and are too timid for most people's tastes , ones with health problems ( non-life thretening ) or in some cases ... perfectly good animals who for whatever reason , no one has adopted . my first dog from there was severely abused so he was extremely timid , but an absolute sweetheart though he had a valve problem with his bladder so he needed medication otherwise he'd basically drip pee a little bit . several owners returned him saying he wasn't house-trained , when all he needed was some cheap medication . really a shame , he just desperately wanted someone to attach himself to . when i brought him home he became my shadow . the most recent dog i had ( got him about 10 years ago at the age of 5 ) was one of those " how the fuck have you been in the shelter system for two years ? " dogs . literally the single most perfect lab i've ever had . 120lbs of perfect breeding , he had the most captivating bark ( deep like a dane , which i think he was 1/4 of ) , the best personality and highest intelligence of any dog i've ever known . he was patient and the perfect sort of caregiver type dog . would have made a great disability dog , actually ( perfect candidate for that ) . he spent 2 years in the shelter and they transferred him to the no kill one when the shelter he was at finally was either going to have to put him down or send him somewhere like this particular shelter i go to . i cannot fucking believe gunner could have been one of those dogs that was lost in the abyss of thousands of unwanted animals . someone had loved the shit out of that dog ( he was very well trained when i got him , which i continued after adopting him and he became the best fucking dog on earth to work with , holy shit ... ) i suspect his original owner died and the family just dumped him in the countryside . really unfortunate . but holy shit i am so glad i found that dog . i've had many a great labrador in my life , but gunner was an will always be my " soul-dog " , aka that animal that is like your destined counterpart . he was easily the most important thing that has ever happened to me ... and to think , that could have been lost if places like that shelter weren't around . had to say goodbye to him at the beginning of 2016 , though . hardest thing i've ever had to do ... silly as it seems to some , i'm sure , it was like losing a child . still not even close to over it . never had a death impact me quite so profoundly . no-kill shelters do exist , even if all of them aren't really what they say they are . they're worth it , though . 5 dogs from this place and every single one of them were incredible . i think especially for dogs that have been without a home for so long , there's a profound level of emotion that comes with finally having one , and someone to be their comrade . then again , i've never known an ungrateful dog anyways .	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS * * ( fairly ) quick summary of schrödinger , hugh everett , and many-world / copenhagen interpretations : * * - - - - - - the view at the time ( and still the majority view amongst quantum physicists today ) was that of the ' copenhagen interpretation ' . the view of a cat being both ' simultaneously alive and dead ' was schrödinger's way of pointing out the absurdity in the view . copenhagen interpretation views things as waves of probability , so that cat in that case would literally physically be both alive and dead at the same time ( until observed ) . this has to do with the decoherence of quantum systems into any larger systems , what's known as the " wave-function collapse " . - schrödinger proposed this thought experiment as a means of bringing light to the ( then much much lesser known ) " many-worlds interpretation " that we know so well today . the theory was actually the brain-child of hugh everett , but it was largely ignored , probably because " the theory of universal wavefunction " wasn't quite as catchy . the theory literally proposed that the cat obviously cannot be both alive / dead at once , and basically , it's stating that while we may observe the phenomenon we know of as " wavefunction collapse " , that the wavefunction never truly collapses , and that rather we simply only see the result that is true in this universe ( all other possible results all simultaneously existing as well , in their own universes ) . - the main point of contention on this theory , is the occam's razor argument . logically , many physicists argue , if a theory requires an infinite infinite amount of parallel worlds , then that's definitely not the simplest logical solution right ? maybe , but many-worlds believers ( me included ) argue that it is mathematically the simplest solution . infinite may be a large number , but ignoring the sheer quantity , it does explain away most of the leading questions with quantum weirdness with the least amount of added confusion , more questions , or additional extremely complicated maths needed . - additionally , it's worth noting , that you could potentially view both of these views as ( possible ) viable ways of viewing the exact same thing . so , semantics aside , the debate may largely be a philosophical one ( in that both theories could potentially explain the same thing with equal correctness . maybe ) .	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS yes and no . to clarify , because this is often confused , there are several types of bottled water : ( 1 ) * * purified water * * - this is distilled and minerals are added back . it doesn't matter where the water came from , because the water is devoid of the original contents . purified bottled water is cleaner than any tap or filtered tap you can get . ( 2 ) * * ro water * * - reverse osmosis is applied to remove a large number of impurities , but some still remain . sometimes referred to as a " 7 stage process " or " ro water " . several brands offer this - including dasani and aquafina . it is sometimes called purified ro , but really only distilled is true purified . it is still far cleaner than any tap water , and the source is almost irrelevant . ( 3 ) * * filtered water * * - essentially bottled tap water run through a carbon filter . this is the majority of generic bottled waters that aren't listed as ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) above . you get arsenic and other things that come from the source of the water . ( 4 ) * * spring water * * - unfiltered spring water that can contain pretty much anything as long as it meets drinking standards . arrowhead and other " mountain " waters are this . fiji water is too , i believe . you can buy purified at costco , safeway , etc . all those standard places , and it is superior to your tap water . some people argue that purified is not healthy for you because it is missing a lot of the natural minerals . now back to op - dasani offers purified ro and filtered . depends on which product you buy .	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS you say this , and a lot of people who are against tpp do as well but don't offer up much proof besides anecdotes . the benefits derived by trade deals are for sure ambiguous , but the reason they're signed is to create a unified market . for example i'm canadian , and when my government negotiates deals it does so in the hopes of creating a larger " domestic " market for canadian goods and services that is much larger than the 36 million or so people who live here . now job losses will certainly happen , in certain sectors . one of nafta's biggest problems for us here was that it meant that canadian retailers and manufacturers were gutted , and a lot of the jobs at first were retail , not exactly desirable . it's been a boon for resources and canadian engineering and tech firms , and i guess that those are the sectors the government sees as providing quality jobs for the foreseeable future . there certainly needs to be better protections against job losses to soften the blow while maximizing the benefits , but ultimately the governments involved are just trying to boost economic activity . people blame tpp for benefiting the wealthy when they should be blaming unequal distribution of wealth , something that can be resolved without violating the deal itself . a country that does this better would see wages and other metrics rise as the economy grew . trade deals are a mix bag , not automatically good or bad . tpp brought drawbacks and benefits , and how a country manages the challenges can create great benefit .	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS just a few thoughts . crusade would be unlikely - russia wasn't a worthy target back then , and it certainly did not contain jerusalem in its territory , so a pretext for a crusade would be a little hard to find . on the other hand , marriages between russian and western nobility would be probably almost impossible , and the inter-faith conflict even more pronounced than it was ( but then , orthodox christians and catholics did not like each other very much , too ) . this would force russian princes to seek brides in islamic countries and otherwise strengthen ties with the said countries . it might mean a peaceful acquisition of crimea and the right of free passage from the black sea to mediterranean , which would put russia on the map as a sea-faring nation , tough still at the whim of sultans . beyond that , it's hard to say what changes would be there , as the events would diverge more from our known history as the time went on . would islam help russia beat back the mongol horde ? unlikely : a change of religion would not prevent infighting between princes which weakened the kiev rus . would russia be able to benefit from renaissance and enlightenment in europe , or maybe it would became a place for islamic version of these movements ? so many questions . interestingly enough , there is a sci-fi ( or , rather , " political fiction " ) book that describes a transition of 90 ' s russia to islamic monarchy called " variant i " , in which author describes all possible benefits russia can obtain from this , instead of trying to continue to be a part of the western civilization .	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS i'm gonna piggyback off of this for a bit more info — so , phil tippett had worked as a stop motion animator on the original star wars movies ( the holochess game in anh , the tauntauns and at-ats in esb , etc . ) , then founded his own studio where he had done some professional dinosaur animations of his own in the 80s . also robocop's ed - 209 . he was at the top of the go-motion movie special effects world , so of course for jurassic park he's the guy you would go to . and then ilm's cgi team came along out of the blue demoing they could do dinosaur animation in cgi ( think of terminator 2 in 1991 , which was super impressive cutting edge , but they only tried to do liquid shiny metal , not giant , frame-filling skin and scales and eyes and teeth and everything ) . and at first it was like tippett's whole world dropped out from under him , and he realized stop motion was basically over . but , he adapted . [ he stayed in charge of dinosaur effects ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/06/11/10/2988624C00000578-3119673-image-m-10_1434015641205.jpg ) , and he and ilm together made telemetry devices so that the digital models's bones would follow the armatures manipulated by traditional animators in real life to create keyframes and all that . both complementing the computer graphics guys who might not have had years of creature animation experience , and allowing his animators to smoothly transition to 3d digital animation work . plus , for pre-visualization they actually did stop motion tests of entire scenes anyway . so here you can see [ the entire raptors in the kitchen scene in stop motion as part of preproduction . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLceoQGfK-c& ) after jurassic park , he went on to modernize his effects studio , and they did cgi on movies like starship troopers . if anyone wants to see / hear more from this time , [ vice did a neat documentary on him . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTGQ_K0DBPo )	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS * william chaloner set up in a country house a few miles outside of london with some stolen casts to make the new coins . when newton found this out through his informer network , he had him arrested . before a conviction could be rendered , though , chaloner paid key witness thomas holloway to flee to scotland until the case against him collapsed . even more ridiculous , after newton presented a report to parliament detailing the scandal , its members dismissed the accusations and chaloner went straight back to asking for a job at the mint — all the while launching a new scheme forging £ 50 notes and lottery tickets . * * newton was furious . he wanted chaloner hanged . so , he went about constructing an airtight case , using his network of informants and spies around london in methodical fashion to build a comprehensive picture of chaloner ’ s movements and activities over the previous 18 months . he even went undercover himself to gather evidence from witnesses at pubs around the city . when the trial finally came , he had eight witnesses , including the wife of the man chaloner had paid to run away to scotland . ( turns out , he ’ d scammed them out of money as well . ) * * the treason charge stuck , and on a cold , damp march day in 1699 , chaloner was hanged in tyburn . later that year , newton was made the master of the royal mint , a position he would hold until his death in 1727 . * [ source ] ( https://howwegettonext.com/isaac-newton-the-world-s-original-counterfeiter-cop-870d35c4b9bc )	__UNDISCLOSED__

EOS norm abram apparently really disliked bob vila because the guy was basically a bumbling fool around the job site and had no idea what he was talking about . i do recall a few " well , bob ...
