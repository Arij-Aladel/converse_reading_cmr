this woman was an anomaly back in her day . she voted against the war because , shocker , her district was protesting against u . s . involvement in wwii . voting against the war was so unpopular back then , that an eruption broke out , and people physically hounded her down as soon as she cast the vote . security couldn't really withhold the mob , and she was forced into a tiny phone booth . she couldn't , in good conscience , bring herself to support another war .

these pictures are haunting , but strange . so many of them look more like something out of a post-apocalyptic movie than anything else . who closes a library and leaves all the books ? or leaves all the pictures from the police department files scattered on the floor ? or leaves a pristine looking u . s . flag up in the abandoned church ? some of them have to be staged for dramatic effect .

there is a large amount of potentially quite sensitive data lying around in an abandoned space . that is bad policy in my book .
you know what got me about those pictures .. how little thieves value books .. in several shots , there are row upon row of books , untouched and unread . at the very least , they could be redeployed to other library systems .. i worked in down town detroit for a while , lived and worked in the " tubes " before the casinos were built .. have to say , even then it was sad to see what happens to a city that loses its heart .

you know what else is crazy . the orbits of the planets ? circular almost perfectly circular . all those ellipses shit you see in pictures . total bullshit .
<TRNC> true that the earth is indeed fatter at the equator , it's fatter by * much * less than most people think . saying " the earth isn't a sphere " would be just as disingenuous as saying " a basketball isn't a sphere " . the earth's bulge is invisible to the naked eye and , for <NUM>th - grade purposes , it's really okay to call it a sphere . you might as well have argued that rulers are technically not straight . but then again , technically correct * is * the best kind of correct .

<TRNC> degree of precision you would then have to talk about things like tide level and local gravitic variations . this is exactly why they changed it : you don ’ t want your units of measurement to depend on something that takes a page of qualifiers to describe in the first place . if you just want a quick answer , [ wolfram alpha says it ’ s about <NUM> , <NUM> meters ] . so you could say that our meters now are <NUM> pre - <NUM> centimeters long , but there would be lots of valid quibbles .
i know , but " til that there is an unconfirmed story that edward ii might possibly have been ass-raped with a hot plumber's iron , but this might not actually have happened " just didn't have the same ring to it . regardless of its truth , the fact that the story is out there is interesting in itself .

we can't be sure , if they only measure the ball diameter
what about if the speed of light is variable ?
oh i see what you mean : it is assumed to be a perfect sphere , and its diameter must be within the tolerance . i was thinking that if you have a rough billiards ball , all points on the surface must be within the tolerance .

it isn't a good idea to compare two countries with completely different populations , geography , size , population distribution , etc .

it's damn hard to find online clothing retailers willing to ship to australia , any suggestions ?
> because we were too short sighted to get in and set up an internet delivery stream missing the point entirely . even with an " internet delivery stream " they would still be required to charge gst . they are an australian company so by australian law they must collect gst with all of their sales . international companies * do not * have this requirement . i think it's a perfectly valid complaint .

i have never successfully watched an entire nba game on account of this . some of the things they call make absolutely no sense . i'd expect referee ' skills ' like that from ' third tier ' college ball teams , where it's basically for fun and scholarships ... but i suppose being in on it monetarily will make it a bit easier for them to sleep at night <TRNC>

haha , sorry . how does it work , anyway ? is the team described in the article still considered the same team as the one playing in cleveland today ? i guess at this point the ravens are considered an expansion team .
i think that technically the current browns are an expansion team . the ravens are the relocated and renamed browns of old . as much as the whole debacle pains me as a browns fan , at least art modell is finally gone from cleveland .

afaik it's the opposite . the browns franchise was suspended and baltimore was awarded a new franchise . later the cleveland franchise was reactivated by the league .

art modell took the existing browns team at the time to baltimore to create the ravens . cleveland was awarded an expansion team by the nfl , which they named the browns and that browns team was able to keep the browns records and history .

well you can also get sacked for a very large loss , and have a higher chance of no yards whatsoever .

that's true of all sniper shots . you will always have a " lob " when shooting long and it generally takes a few rounds down range to get a feel for the wind conditions . it's not a " <NUM> shot <NUM> kill " thing in the movies , it's more like " shit , someone is shooting bullets at me and i can't figure out where they are coming from !

no he timed the shot , up the guy kept bending over and standing up , and when he bent over he pulled the trigger , and sure as clock work the guy stood up . and killed him at around like <NUM> yards . iirc . * * edit * * also the reason for mouthing the scope on the m<NUM> , was that hathcocks base was on top of a hill and the vietcong would harass soldiers coming and going from patrol missions right out side the <NUM><NUM> , <NUM> yard mark
interesting fact : the pittsburgh hockey pirates once swept the pittsburgh baseball pirates in a seven game series of baseball .

<TRNC> the * real * running game of the nfl . so the browns came into the nfl and and whooped the defending champs twice , once purely by running the ball straight down their throats . it wasn't that they were the first to win without a forward pass ; it was that they were considered an inferior team that relied on the ' gimmick ' of the forward pass . so the browns ran straight at the eagles all game long . it wasn't about being the first , it was about proving that they were the best .

<TRNC> they do is pass " , was their first nfl game . it was week one , and the commissioner set the game up to demonstrate that the browns , though champions of the old aafc , were no comparison to an nfl team . he set them up on the road against the defending champ eagles to prove his point . when the browns won <NUM><NUM> , the nfl looked pretty foolish , and when reporters asked neale what happened to his vaunted eagles , his only recourse was clutching at straws , leading to his absurd comment .
<TRNC> home games after the move was announced , there was no advertising anywhere in municipal stadium . a team that drew <NUM> plus no matter how bad they were couldn't give away tickets to the game . every last piece of browns regalia disappeared from every restaurant , bar , corner shop , and public space in the city overnight . art modell has still not returned to cleveland , nor would he be welcome . but just to be clear on one point : art modell took his team to baltimore , but the browns never left cleveland .
paul brown was a fucking bad ass , no question about it . as a bengal's fan , it's pretty unfortunate how far the apple falls from the tree as his son is a complete moron .
lol i wouldn't be surprised if it were true .
whenever i hear the words " the forward pass " in my mind its always in a <NUM>s newsreel voice .

he brought the other guy's rifle back with him as proof , and then some fucking remf stole it .

that thing is so narrow it looks like it would gouge his eye out .
the m<NUM> on a tripod like that doesn't exactly move a whole ton . see [ this video ] getting behind the scope would require a fairly uncomfortable position and some flexibility , but he'd be using a spotter scope to locate targets , and only contorting down to actually take the shot .
i don't think that's the point . i think the point is the browns deciding to mock the eagles coach that way .
it's been a while since i've read the book but i'm pretty sure it wasn't stolen . his command just didn't let him take it out of the country . on a side note . i've got what's probably the only copy of marine sniper signed by the dude .
good . no , seriously . i think it's a very good thing that a senator who has been charged * but not convicted * continues to hold his position and all the benefits which accompany it . if the senate is to be even the slightest bit effective , it must be * * independent * * - - and if someone can lose their job based on unproven allegations , they're not independent .

for argument's sake , let's assume that the senator is guilty of all charges . he has still done far less harm than harper .
they thought it was oregano .
to be fair , possession in california has been a $ <NUM> fine and no jail time for a couple decades . the only thing that changed here is that as of jan . <NUM>st it's no longer a misdemeanor , which means you don't have to show up in court to get sentenced to your $ <NUM> and it doesn't stay on your criminal record for two years . now it's just like a parking ticket .

wonder why you're gettin ' the down-votes . just came to say , if you want to play with a super-object-oriented-language , [ give ruby a go ] . not saying it's the best language in the world , but it was my first experience . i think it has a lot of value in scripting and learning fundamentals . also , they have an [ online interactive console and tutorial ] that you can play with at their site .

theres a big difference between a software engineer and a programmer . a software engineer can usually write code , but a computer programmer can't necessarily design a complex system . i think a lack of understanding of the difference is a contributing factor to the problem of so many software project failures compared to other engineering projects .

<TRNC> java , and even c + + don't have this effect . if you really don't want to learn c , then i'd recommend python . python is such a fun language to work in , and is definitely a great choice when it comes to learning . however , if you're * * serious * * about programming . that is , if you want to be writing non-trivial code and have a significant impact in large projects , you really should learn c before anything else . if you have any questions , just let me know .

<TRNC> . this is the problem . companies are hiring strongly for sde's but you have to be good in order to actually get a job . i've interviewed a lot of people and the vast majority of them are clueless idiots who have no idea what they're doing . some of these people have been in the industry for years , and some have worked for major companies . if you're good at writing code , you'll get a job easily . if you suck at it , you're not going to find anywhere that will actually hire you .

if you come down on the java side of that question , go with c # instead . much more pleasant to learn , better integrated software stack . you can pick up java really easily after , but c # actually has more features so you'll learn more , and imo it's a better language to work with .

be nicer to the qa guys . if they're doing their jobs well , they'll add regression tests from tickets , and do the tedious code grinding that it takes to come up with full coverage testing of all execution paths , which makes sure the software works , and makes us look better . seriously , buy them a brew once in a while . if they're not already doing all that , maybe you can talk them into it over suds .

<TRNC> years of education including a painful residency should be enough to turn most people away . the hours are long and erratic , and to top it all off , they don't make the kind of money they used to make . the <NUM>th time a <NUM>lb woman told me that she doesn't understand why she has high blood pressure because she eats right and exercises , i would not be responsible for my actions . i'd take a <NUM>k job that lets me work anywhere over a <NUM>k job that makes me work in <NUM> or <NUM> cities .
if you're going to school , you'll be learning either c + + or java and usually an assembly class is required along the way .

so ... i'm a computer engineering major , and at my internship , i program software for windows in c # , and embedded systems in c or assembly . does that make me a software engineer ?
actually , when you're doing embedded work you do wear anti-static lab coats . they look dumb as hell , but since most labs are too damn cold it's kind of nice to have the extra insulation . oh , and since you aren't supposed to have food in the lab , i generally fill my pockets with m & ms .
yeah , i looked it up and it seems ... fairly subtle if you ask me .
minimum wage is still a higher income level than unemployed =P
you don't get that kind of shit when interviewing at companies like expedia , microsoft , amazon , etc .

yeah and that salary is more than decent . one of the perks of working in the us i guess : tech salaries = mucho dinero
hey , it's only stressful if you let it be . unlike , say , surgery , where there's damned good reasons to be stressed out . and if you're programming for a bunch of other people and you can't deal with their requests , have you considered just saying " no " ? as the article said , jobs are plentiful these days :)

true enough . the only mildly stressful things i've encountered as a software engineer have been during field tests and they've been relatively mundane things like being trapped on a burning boat in stormy waters , surprise underground nuclear testing , flying into suddenly rising clouds of tens of thousands of birds , the odd coup d'état attempt , near decapitation by hydraulic robot arms wielding flesh cutting shears . . . you know , the usual stuff .

too bad : we had a new hires briefing by the person in charge of security , a lady who might have been something like a seal or green beret or something scary like that , in a previous life , and several years later , i still lock religiously my office door , and filing cabinets and such , hide all prototypes , shred documents every time i leave the office , even to go to the bathroom ... even though she no longer works there ; that's how strong the impression she left .

<TRNC> actually understand this . i hope that there are people out there with the same mentality as you two in management positions . even as a student , there have been numerous times where i've wracked my brain for hours trying to find a bug or fix a problem , only to fix it in a matter of minutes after a decent mental break . i think this is a common problem for programmers . and it is only reinforced by the mentality that ' if only you work harder or longer , your problem will be solved ' .
my favorite chain emails are the ones that link to snopes , and the snopes article itself says that the email is a hoax .
the fact that gov't agencies were party to the assassination plot shouldn't surprise anybody . the fbi already admits to targeting the civil rights movement , women's rights movement , vietnam anti-war movement , etc . with their highly illegal [ cointelpro ] program .
when i was a manager , having known this need from my own coding , i usually just told my subordinates i don't care what they do , as long as they deliver what i ask of them . staring at comics - no problem , <NUM> long coffee-breaks chit-chatting in the hallway - no problem . just deliver the results and we're fine . it worked quite well .
i'm white and i think believing in conspiracies is nuts without proof . btw nice unchecked reverse-racist statements guys . that's the beauty of conspiracies . evidence for it , even from unreliable sources , is considered gold .. evidence against it is just more proof that there is a conspiracy . oj was innocent . the government blew up the levees in new orleans to kill poor people . mlk was a government contract . vaccinations are mind control . yup , all some crazy-ass shit . * edit : fix typos

i was speaking toward official stances the government has taken that look to be wrong . those in power quiet intelligent debate by calling the opposition wackos or " nuts " and instantly brand it a conspiracy theory . there will always be fake conspiracies too like you mentioned because there are idiots of every color and creed . my wording might have been better if i'd said * all * white people won't call you nuts . especially since this hit the front page .

nutjobs are nutjobs . it's not like electing them prevents all nutjobbery . someone in the government has just as good a chance of being crazy as anyone walking past you on the street . edit : seeing downvotes here . explanation : i mean that there's no reason to think that government agents wouldn't be doing something like this if there was evidence pointing toward it . the government isn't full of saints .

<TRNC> hire yahuda katz . syntax doesn't mean shit - it only means something if your resume portrays it as being a relevant factor . now , beyond that , as a developer - i would highly suggest python and getting informed about the web as much as possible . fact of the matter is - in large enterprises desktop apps are going away - the web is at a point in can provide the exact same experience and responsiveness as a desktop application . i would focus on python , javascript , php , ruby - in that order .
it doesn't matter . aim for what you want to do , then go on a site like craig's list and look through the jobs of that section . see what they require , then learn those skills .
lol , [ wikipedia link ] - the official explanation =)
lawyers are screwed . i have a friend who just got his law degree and , yeah , he got f'd . but for doctors things are still pretty good . the problem is that the money made by other top professions is way higher now , so from the perspective of a trader at gs doctors don't appear to make that much money .

yeah . everybody knows that lab coats provide a + <NUM> research bonus .
no . a million fucking times no . at least at my curriculum i have taken linear algebra , logic and descriete math , algorithms , relational mathamatics and stats if it counts . funny fact , math is not just calculus , weird eh ? but hey what do i know , i just started my third year
in common usage you are correct . theoretically engineers would be programmers who could also design a system , but the terms have merged to an extent thanks to overuse of the term engineer and lack of regulation on the title . personally i have a software engineering degree and my title at work is software development engineer , but the latter title means very little since it is applied liberally .
<TRNC> why the former is paid more . edit : ha ! nice to see i'm getting downvoted for stating the truth . wouldn't want anyone to read something against the hivemind , would we ? edit <NUM> : from wikipedia : the term programmer can be used to refer to a software developer , software engineer , computer scientist , or software analyst . however , members of these professions typically possess other software engineering skills , beyond programming ; for this reason , the term programmer is sometimes considered an insulting or derogatory oversimplification of these other professions .
so why add " and no one knows " in the title ? english is a funny language like that .
<TRNC> so hard to keep that in mind when everyone is breathing down your neck to * get it out the door as fast as possible , but so help you fsm if things break ! ! ! * . but you're right . the people breathing down my neck have way more at stake than i do . it also helps to think about the fact that if worse comes to worse and i burn out / get canned , they paid me enough that i can go recover from my ptsd on a tropical island for a year .

<TRNC> software engineering might include some inventing new ways of doing things if that was necessary . and there's certainly a lot of practical day to day coding and debugging involved in typical computer science . lastly , job descriptions are often inaccurate . just because your job description is " computer scientist " doesn't necessarily mean your work won't be <NUM> % software engineering . the corporate types who slap labels on jobs often don't know the above distinction , and couldn't really care less . they just name the job whatever they think sounds good at the moment .

i dunno about software developers , but for engineers , people that take professional responsibility for the quality , performance , reliability and safety of a various systems , there is a particular risk of stress from overwork and / or worry that's not insignificant .

i have never really understood what part of chiropractics is considered to be bogus . a friend of mine has a curved spine and has back aches with some regularity , when he does he goes the the chiropractor whom i believe gives him something similar to a massage after which he feels better . is my friend experiencing a placebo effect or does chiropractors make other health claims which are bunk but the claims of helping pushing spinal disks into place and relaxing muscles are valid ?
it proofs nothing !

eastwood directs well , malpaso made the best westerns ever after the genre was thought to be dead . letters from iwo jima is brilliant and was difficult . howard is to directing what hanks is to acting - makes sappy saccarine crap that makes the common white folk feel good about themselves ... which is largely what the academy awards are about . this year's looks to be one of the worst ever .

wait , gary oldman's in air force one ?
it tells you something about the value of the academy award .
probably because he is a character actor who rarely gets the lead role . there are tons of great actors who haven't gotten an award so he's in good company . glenn close , kirk douglas , mia farrow , cary grant , madeline kahn , angela lansbury , peter o'toole , peter sellers , donald sutherland , orson welles <TRNC>

i might not have got the meaning but the magic in it really bugged me . dystopia novels are supposed to be based on reality ! i really did like the beginning of the book but the transmitting of memories through the backs of people was really stupid and caused me to hate the second part . her other book " number the stars " pissed me off even more . the girl did absolutely nothing and the suspense in the book was brought about by stupidity . edit : spelling

<TRNC> followed by diluting their brand with _ten_ frickin ' nominees for best picture . having said that , the fact that the oscars picks wrongly on a number of occasions doesn't mean they don't pick a solid , respectable choice the large majority of the time . a lot of people can't stand the fact that others have different opinions on art and that those other opinions have merit . halle barry did a fantastic job in monster's ball . none of that , of course , means that crash wasn't an objectively terrible choice . fuck that movie .

his time will come . i'd have to say my favorite role of his was in the professional .
i think all the newer ones are designed this way , or at least at some point in the <NUM> ' s , they switched to an exterior food court for new costcos . might be exclusive to california however , because of the climate . also the outdoor ones i've been to always had very long waits . for for the price of the pizza , it's worth it .

* nil by mouth * was based loosely on oldman's childhood .
already on it . i still do a double take every time i realize he's the same actor in so many roles ...
when i was a child , i always knew him as zorg . i didn't even know his actual name , he was just zorg . after seeing prisoner of azkaban and swooning over sirius black , i imdbed him and nearly shat myself .

part of the man's brilliance is how he becomes the character rather than being type-cast ... just look at some of the roles he has played and how vastly differant the characters are ... he looks , sounds and acts completely differant in every role he plays ... it's to the point where if it wern't pointed out , you may not even recognise him . deffinately one of the best and most under-rated actors ever .

don't forget its relative the amanita muscaria , pictured [ here ] and [ here ] . it has strong hallucinogenic properties that aren't diluted by consumption . in the olden days , a holy man would eat one , and his devotees would drink his urine and experience the same effects . however amanita spores often fuse to the caps of their relatives , so that when you eat an amanita muscaria you might also be getting a taste of amanita virosa <TRNC>

in college , my mycology professor mentioned that he had been called as an expert witness in a murder trial which involved this mushroom . it seems that the killer slightly modified the mushrooms so that they looked more like a harmless mushroom , and then cooked up some dish of them as a meal for his victims . they were supposedly a wild-mushroom-savvy family , so they suspected nothing .

romanian league better than the bundesliga and ligue <NUM> in <NUM><NUM> ? ukrainian league is on the top , above the epl , spl , bundesliga and serie a in <NUM><NUM> ? there has to be something wrong with this table . for one , it doesn't measure which league is ' better ' .

it is impossible to cause a nuclear explosion in a nuclear fission power plant .
yeah , a nuclear explosion isn't really the concern , there just isn't enough fissile fuel for that . a steam explosion which expels radioactive material into the atmosphere is the real problem . but like the article said , there are many redundant safety measures in place . often , such as at three mile island there is a serious problem due to operator error . the automatic safety measures are good enough that in germany , the operators have to leave the control room for one hour after an alarm before touching anything .
<TRNC> less than a millisecond i believe to fully play out . as in , all of the mass has converted to energy . a nuclear reactor takes that and stretches it over a longer period of time so that the core doesn't have to withstand a ten kiloton nuclear weapon going off inside it every so often . it's the difference between lighting a gallon of gasoline and driving your car . one will burn up very quickly , one will burn much slower but will produce energy that's useful for more things than just setting things on fire .
not for civilian reactors . military reactors use a significantly higher enrichment .
there are only a few dozen people in the us who still use an iron lung
agreed . it is correct that a nuclear reactor and a bomb work by the same principle but lighting a match isn't really considered setting off a small conventional explosive is it ?
fucking reactors ...
depends on the kind of heating element .. if it's natural gas , sure , it's an exothermic chemical reaction between the natural gas and the oxygen , that requires heat to be added to kickstart the reaction . an electric heater just inserts thermal energy into the air around it , not much chemical reaction there .
no ... one is chemical , one is nuclear , one is electrical . they are all very different things . that would set the electric heating element on equal footing for comparisons .
primitive nuclear designs could result in disastrous steam explosions . i humbly submit for reddit's approval : [ the sl - <NUM> incident ] .

or think about the fortunate fellows who first ate " rotten " food and found it tasted good . things like bleu cheese , kimchi , surströmming which smell spoiled yet are " edible " . or the lucky person who found if you let yeast ferment sugar you get alcohol .
this is why i'm glad i have a painting of a sad crying clown in an iron lung .
tyl also that a chernobyl-like incident in the united states is impossible .
point is , a nuclear reaction is a nuclear explosion . even if it only involves the splitting of one atom . explosions are simply exothermic reactions , and a fission releases energy .

" everyone else " is the subject in either event . the question is what you're comparing yourself to . if you're comparing yourself to the sex , as in people are having more of sex than they are having of you , then " me " is correct . if you're comparing yourself to them , then you are both subjects , and " i " is correct .

i'd think that it'd be far more likely if you had any cuts or ulcers in your mouth . than your stomach .
what ? how ? seriously , i thought aids is that widespread precisely because it has an incredibly high infection chance . with these numbers in mind , people would have to have unprotected sex thousands of times to spread the disease . if we say , people have sex <NUM> times per day , it means it could take several years for a person to infect one of his / her partners . then the next partner would need to have sex hundreds and thousands of times again to infect the next one , etc .
sex education revolves around fear mongering . think about it . you take a girl home , you both think " well , the chances of infection are less than <NUM> % ... aw , what the hell ? " and you go at it raw . maybe you don't spread aids but if everyone takes this attitude then a whole bunch of other stuff spreads , including unplanned pregnancies . while i understand the approach , i really don't like it at all .

that far down i thought it's only about extracting water , nevertheless the water would have to go somewhere and so does the semen . yet i thought that you increase the chances a lot if you have a wound and the butt is probably a bit more sensitive than a vagina or a penis .

you are forgetting adverse selection - - a bad mistake . if she is willing to do it unsafely with you , chances are she's been willing to do it unsafely with others , thus much more likely infected .
<TRNC> many and most disease agents come in different strains . since it most stis have periods of non symptomatic latency it is impossible to determine who is infected without lab testing . the chances of hiv passing from an hiv carrier with no other stis to a person with no stis is truly low , so monogamous serodiscordant couples can have sex quite safely . but if one has sex with someone who has a latent sti and recently got hiv and is in the acute infection stage , then hiv transmission is more likely than not to occur .

what is the difference between receptive penile-vaginal intercourse and insertive penile-vaginal intercourse . whether you are giving or receiving ?
you tie them on with a string ? ? i used to use them fairly often and i've never seen that . also , their efficacy as a contraceptive method is pretty much the same as latex , except that the lambskin have a slightly higher probability of breaking . if they stay on / intact , they're good .

<TRNC> many and most disease agents come in different strains . since it most stis have periods of non symptomatic latency it is impossible to determine who is infected without lab testing . the chances of hiv passing from an hiv carrier with no other stis to a person with no stis is truly low , so monogamous serodiscordant couples can have sex quite safely . but if one has sex with someone who has a latent sti and recently got hiv and is in the acute infection stage , then hiv transmission is more likely than not to occur .

<TRNC> pay their own bill even though at first glance one might feel " why the fuck should i pay for these guys ? " . these are deeply disturbed individuals and i wouldn't say they're making a rational decision . some might just be young , stupid and not realizing the consequences of course . many express a will to " take down " as many as possible before dying , some seem to be under the illusion that aids is a gift for connecting homosexuals in a way that only heterosexuals could before , through birth . bizarre .

<TRNC> have the statistics for low-income countries on there , so it's not too difficult to extrapolate from there with regards to vaginal sex . also , as for blood transfusions , the statistics reference the likelihood of infection from an infected source . so , the chart shows the rate of infections you would expect to see if you had <NUM> people receive infected blood . it doesn't really matter if you're in africa , canada , or the moon , if you receive infected blood from a transfusion , you have a ~ <NUM> % chance of infection .
i thought maybe it was a whole lamb
i would imagine it's just a corollary to those other factors that actually have a pathway for transmission . for example , poor people are less likely to use condoms because they cost money . they are more likely , if infected , to be in a contagious phase because they cannot afford expensive treatments . et cetera <TRNC>
well ... more like poor health care , poor health education , malnutrition , aversion to the use of condoms , polygamous relationships , denial , aids babies , social aversions , sex workers , etc ...

it's impossible . every doctor knows that , edit : should know that , him spearing irrational fear rather than truth is counterproductive and reckless . but i'm arguing with a moron so i digress .
so true , i've never done it more than <NUM> times a day .
> whereas you have to catch and be invaded by an infection . merely the state of having an infection does not necessarily make one diseased . food for thought .
hiv is transfered through blood , which is why it is most common in gays and blacks . gays have anal sex which lead to bleeding , and the blacks big dicks tear that pussy up , which again , leads to bleeding .
<TRNC> to get k = <NUM> . now we can calculate p ' = <NUM> - ^ <NUM> = approximately <NUM> , which means you've gone from a <NUM> % chance to a <NUM> % chance of infection . <NUM> % isn't * huge * , but still , that's bigger than wikipedia initially suggested . note also that the number of times you put yourself at risk matters : if you slept with the girl <NUM> times , then p ' = <NUM> = <NUM> % . this has the potential to be one seriously messed up computer game .
and a person can very well have a disease without having been infected .
i think reddit is turning into a bunch of vaginas .
that in penile-vaginal intercourse with an hiv-infected partner , a woman has an estimated <NUM> % chance of being infected , and a man <NUM> % . am i the only one who thought it was higher ?
existing prevalence and injection drug use . if the pool of potential people you're having sex with includes more people that have hiv , your odds are higher of getting it . and there is a correlation between iv drug use and income . access to health care is also a factor , as poorer people are less likely to get tested and thus more likely to unknowingly pass it on to others . has nothing to do with hygiene or frequency of intercourse .
people used to pay a great deal of money for the privilege of being an unpaid apprentice , it's not a big deal . just get it over with and use the experience to get a paying job . experience is valuable to yourself anyway if you do it right .

<TRNC> an adult would earn . so for example , a <NUM> year old working the same job might be making <NUM> % of a <NUM> year old at the same store in the same position this is aggravated further by the fact that people can be paid less for " training " . so if you're a <NUM> year old working a summer job , they can pay you fuck all becaubout se you're under <NUM> , and then even less because you're " training " and by the time you aren't training summers over and you're back at school

<TRNC> true - - in college i'd dated this gal for a few months , she was nice , intelligent , but after a few months of her not putting out i lost interest . <NUM> years later i had a g / f and she confided she had a " really weird fetish . " she said " i like my boyfriends to sleep with my friends . " i said , " fabulous ! " the first friend she wanted me to sleep with ? turned out to be the gal i'd dated in college <NUM> years earlier .
not really . cuckoldry is sexual pleasure . compersion is emotional happiness / satisfaction .

and moore continues his pursuit of pure hipster-ism . he writes some good stuff , but if you listened to him , you would think that nothing new has been done in comics since the last time he published . hell he acts like marvel's mircale man reprints are simply because the company has no other way to make money or have good ideas . at least that's the last interview i read with him from comic heroes magazine .
<TRNC> all these figures are for a woman , if you're a dude you are even less likely to get infected . btw , if you are heterosexual , please don't use this as an excuse to have unprotected sex . there are plenty of stis out there . plus pregnancy , of course . be safe ! plus this doesn't even take into account bluerasberry's comments about the chance of infection going up if there is another sti involved . i can't comment on the validity of that point , i just think the math given above is mistaken .

> the sikhs said that , while their own religion forbids covering women ’ s faces , they planned to speak out against the bill [ which would deny services to women with covered faces ] anyway , in the name of religious tolerance . can we follow this example instead ? i'm googling trying to find a single instance of a kirpan being used as a weapon . no luck so far . [ edit : nevermind , found one from brampton . ]
they came out for their own interests . if there is a precedence set for following laws regardless of religious beliefs , it will affect them as well when it comes to future rulings regarding the kirpan .
and ? hasn't this been going on for decades ?
it is in everyone's interest that we should maintain our tradition of religious tolerance .
people used to pay a great deal of money for the privilege of being an unpaid apprentice , it's not a big deal . just get it over with and use the experience to get a paying job . experience is valuable to yourself anyway if you do it right .
for sure , but it seems to be a one way road . there should be some adherence to the law of the land . in this case not allowing daggers into the legislature was the right decision . no weapons allowed . regardless of it's religious symbolism , it is in the end a weapon .
let's clear something up here . this wasn't about banning them in canada , this was about not letting somebody into the quebec legislature with a concealed weapon . my opinion is that a ceremonious dagger pin or other such harmless symbol is ok , and should be acceptable , as is permitted by their faith . when something can be used as a weapon , there are certain places it should not be allowed .
i am the high priest of the church of ak - <NUM> and i demand entry !
is someone really going to walk on to the floor of the legislature and go on a rampage with a <NUM> inch blade ? especially knowing that it would not only violate the basic tenants of their religion but would also bring recrimination against their community ? if we're seriously worried about tiny ceremonial knives , should we also ban pencils and pens from the legislature ? how about people with really strong hands ?
i want to raise my kid as a samurai . he needs to have his katana with him at all times .
why should people who believe in the supernatural be afforded special rights ? shouldn't the law apply equally to everyone ? also , from a security standpoint , if someone wanted to stab someone else , all they would have to do is claim to be a sikh , and then what ? no questions asked , in the name of " tolerance " ?
sure , now we're talking serious security threat . if someone with an unchained , <NUM> ft long kirpan came in , then the threat outweighs his right of expression .
who's worried ? if your argument is that we shouldn't be worried about people bringing daggers / knives / whatever into the building in question , then , fine , allow them for all . again , why should people who believe in the supernatural be afforded special rights ?
possibly when it becomes an actual problem , rather than a hypothetical . why is it ok to bring potentially dangerous items like steel pens into the legislature ? because in reality , that's never a problem . the same logic should apply . there is nobody threatening the quebec legislature with tiny ceremonial knives , so tiny ceremonial knives should not be banned there .
and the important difference is ?
those are my thoughts exactly . places like schools should not allow daggers . i was very disappointed by the supreme court ruling in that case .
i never thought i'd say this . but can the rest of canada please follow quebec's example .
we should also be banning screwdrivers , glass bottles and pencils from schools . scary stuff !
<TRNC> especially knowing that it would not only violate the basic tenants of their religion but would also bring recrimination against their community ? let's generalize it . is someone really going to ever stab someone with a <NUM> inch blade ? let's let * everyone * carry <NUM> inch daggers into courts , primary schools , airplanes and the legislature then . there are tens of thousands of sikhs in canada . can you personally attest every single one of them would never commit a violent offence ? kirpans have indeed been used for attempted murder in canada before :
just because they call it a ceremonial dagger doesn't change the fact that they are still daggers . daggers are weapons and weapons are not allowed in the legislature . i don't think just because there is religious symbolism behind it , they should be exempt from the law .
lots of things have been used for attempted murder in canada . you can beat someone to death with a shoe . should everyone in the legislature have to take off their shoes ? > let's generalize it . i don't see why the general case is relevant to deciding this particular case . ignoring the particularities doesn't seem like a good way of reasoning here .
i never thought i'd say this . but can the rest of canada please follow quebec's example .
> the sikhs said that , while their own religion forbids covering women ’ s faces , they planned to speak out against the bill [ which would deny services to women with covered faces ] anyway , in the name of religious tolerance . can we follow this example instead ? i'm googling trying to find a single instance of a kirpan being used as a weapon . no luck so far . [ edit : nevermind , found one from brampton . ]
i think a logical solution would be to have decorative kirpans that are a sheath and handle , and no actual blade . the symbolism remains in tact and the weapon aspect is removed .
stabbings ? no . but we've seen recently people posing as muslim women to rob banks in montreal . pretending to be religious to get away with something a minority is allowed to is catching on with the criminal element . and of course , the quebec government doesn't evoke * strong feelings * amongst the population , and no one has ever gone on a murderous rampage in the national assembly before
brampton , saw that coming , brampton is what i like to call brownton ..
i'll make you a deal . when everyone in canada stops referring to domestic murders as " honour killings " , we can stop considering the kirpan a religious symbol and start considering it a weapon . and i'm not addressing this just to the op here ; in my experience the people who are enraged about issues like this are also terribly concerned about so-called honour killings . the knife , as it were , cuts both ways .
one is a blade with a sharp point made of metal with a handle for ease use , the other is plastic or wood tipped with graphite or metal and is not made to gut things . i do not see how you cannot tell the difference between a dagger and a pen / pencil .
dude , the proper subversively racist name for brampton is bramladesh , get it right .
knives are particularly effective at causing bodily harm , and their only purpose in the legislature * would * be to commit assault . there's no pragmatic purpose . it's not a pen . it's not a shoe .
dude , the proper subversively racist name for brampton is bramladesh , get it right .
kinda makes you wonder what the actual chances of getting pregnant are .
imo , that's showing unnecessary intolerance towards a legitimate part of society that you don't personally agree with . you'd be preventing them from taking part , because of your beliefs . are you offended by their display of certain artifacts that they use to demonstrate they belong to a certain group ? reddit t-shirts should be banned too , then .
those are my thoughts exactly . places like schools should not allow daggers . i was very disappointed by the supreme court ruling in that case .

the question becomes where do you draw the line ?
apparently he's doing a book called " neonomicon " a sort of lovecraftian thing but from all i've heard it's really ... out there .
look , this can all be solved with a very simple solution : i'm as atheist , if i can walk in to the legislature carrying [ insert religious thing here ] and not be turned away , then anyone can . however , if i'm not allowed my dagger , then nobody should be allowed a dagger . simple .
> your opinions , frankly , are irrelevant . this is a legal issue . canada , as per the charter of rights and freedoms , allows religious freedom with only reasonable limits upon that freedom . my religion mandates that i carry a fully loaded ak - <NUM> around with me at all times . problem ?
i don't know for sure but that might fall under " reasonable limits " . just so we stop with ridiculous stawman arguments , it's defined in section <NUM> of the charter . enjoy :
<TRNC> chance . honestly ... most gals who would be willing do to such things are fucked in the head and thus impossible to have a relationship with for any length of time , nor should you try . there is a very very very small cross-section of well-adjusted-enough and kinky-enough females , i've met exactly one gal who fits this description , and i've been on dates with <NUM> to <NUM> women . the sad truth is , when you meet a woman whose they type you should marry , she's bound to be a bit plain in bed .
muslim women are allowed to rob banks ?
unlikely ? getting hit by lightening is unlikely but possible , inthat it has happened but it is rare . hiv has never been transmitted thriuh saliva on a dick , ever .
muslim women are allowed to rob banks ?
no , but they're allowed their head covering , which doesn't draw attention immediately from security the same way the traditional bank robber ski mask does .
no , but they're allowed their head covering , which doesn't draw attention immediately from security the same way the traditional bank robber ski mask does .
there are a lot of things that the rest of canada should follow quebec's example on . but the wholesale rejection of multiculturalism is not one of them .
i was talking about how uncommon it has become for people to carry pocket knives the other day with some friends . many were appalled that i got my first pocket knife from my dad at age <NUM> . i grew up in rural ontario but i live in downtown toronto - the mindset of what a pocket knife represents are * completely * different in these two places . side note : perfect username for the conversation . :)
as a sikh this pisses me off . not the prohibition of the kirpan , rather the stink these guys are raising about it . my little cousin wears one to his elementary school and uses a special one with a rivet through the case that keeps the dagger irreversibly sheathed . for the ceremonial use in prayers at home wear it needs to become unsheathed , he changes it to another one . i think this is a reasonable middle-ground . you want to wear your kirpan in a secure area , then you use a irremovable one .
have you ever been to montreal ?
brampton , saw that coming , brampton is what i like to call brownton ..

ok , first prove that it's [ within reason ] . now prove that [ your religious belief is sincere ] . * * laywered * * - anybody can be a hateful bigot who makes straw arguments - that's why we have the law .
i really don't have a problem with people carrying butter knives or nail clippers on their person .
<TRNC> of having any such assumptions . i think the problem is that by taking the approach you've taken , we give an out to people who come from a , shall we say , polarized viewpoint , and don't force them to address the actual problem . [ this ] is the best piece i've seen on the subject . ) the key quote for me : > they're not associated with muslim countries , that's what they're called when they are associated with muslim countries . when they're associated with rich black guys , they're called oj simpson .
canadianleftie's points are valid . i would also add that these daggers are ceremonial , and most are not sharp . i don't think they pose much more of a threat than pencils and pens .
let's clear something up here . this wasn't about banning them in canada , this was about not letting somebody into the quebec legislature with a concealed weapon . my opinion is that a ceremonious dagger pin or other such harmless symbol is ok , and should be acceptable , as is permitted by their faith . when something can be used as a weapon , there are certain places it should not be allowed .
when i went to ottawa , i had to hand in my swiss army knife before entering parliament . they bagged it and gave me a ticket to pick it up after i left . it was an entirely reasonable thing to do; there's no reason to let people bring weapons into parliament . so why should some weapons be allowed in ? religious reasons ? fine . poof , my religion now says i can carry a gun everywhere .
<TRNC> weapon on every imaginable source you can think of . there is an entire martial art surrounding it's use . do they have a right to it , yes ! concealed in quebec legislature ? no . it's not a proper place for it . same laws as everyone else , for every other weapon . this is not religious freedom debate . this is an object . a non-specific object passed down to a " warrior of justice " . they are in no danger at quebec legislature . no need for defence . no need for kirpan .
there are a lot of things that the rest of canada should follow quebec's example on . but the wholesale rejection of multiculturalism is not one of them .
provided it's actually a ceremonial gun that can't fire a bullet , that shouldn't be a problem . of course , you could always pistol-whip someone with it . then again , you can also bash them over the head with the speaker's chair .
> under that logic you should also legalize all guns , everywhere . just out of curiosity , can you tell me how that follows from my rhetorical question ?
well if the sikhs in this case don't either then it's over and done with .
her husband suffered the horrible disease call alzheimer's disease which basically ruins the sufferer's brain , most notably memory . instead of being jealous about her husband's mistress , she was happy that he could enjoy something in life . she reasoned that love between two individuals can be so complex to allow this . i hope that helped .
as a sikh this pisses me off . not the prohibition of the kirpan , rather the stink these guys are raising about it . my little cousin wears one to his elementary school and uses a special one with a rivet through the case that keeps the dagger irreversibly sheathed . for the ceremonial use in prayers at home wear it needs to become unsheathed , he changes it to another one . i think this is a reasonable middle-ground . you want to wear your kirpan in a secure area , then you use a irremovable one .
this sounds pretty damn reasonable to me . if it can't be unsheathed , or it's a dull wooden dagger , then it isn't a threat . it very much sounds like they're making an issue out of nothing . > the opposition parti québécois , meanwhile , applauded heartily and said canadian-style multiculturalism was unwelcome in quebec . i think this is very telling , and makes me more than a little sad for quebec .
i never thought i'd say this . but can the rest of canada please follow quebec's example .
oh c'mon man ! are we going to run every institution in this country like paranoid fools ? these guys wear this thing for their religion . they are not trying to kill mps . they are there to protest the discrimination they feel is taking place . are we going to deny them the right to hear the legislature because of some ridiculous rule ?

not the ceremonial many sikhs wear to public institutions . they have rounded edges and a dull point . i suppose you could shank someone with one of these things if you put enough force behind it . in any case , doesn't a provincial legislature should have more pressing things to worry about ?
just because they call it a ceremonial dagger doesn't change the fact that they are still daggers . daggers are weapons and weapons are not allowed in the legislature . i don't think just because there is religious symbolism behind it , they should be exempt from the law .

instead lasseter is fucking with disney and ruining their studio . not that they weren't shitty just before him , but lasseter is ruining disney in his way , as opposed to michael eisner's way .
<TRNC> cars , the toy storys , the incredibles - i find to be generic recycled plots from countless other movies . the animation is wonderful , but i require a unique story and pixar doesn't always make that their priority . in general you can judge their plots by how easily you can sum them up : finding nemo : fish gets lost ; dad goes to find him . up : old man lives alone unhappy . decides to fulfill promise to dead wife to visit an area of south america they used to pretend about as children .
he was executive producer for bolt , princess and the frog & tangled ... and was very instrumental in reigniting traditional animation at disney .

they should make a movie where the hero gets separated from what he's used to , then , through the help of a ragtag group of misfits , learns to love his new situation .

no , because they're a laughing stock and no one will take them seriously . i mean , use the remaining chanologists as an example . cos's best threat against us was a fake cease and desist letter with no legal precedent whatsoever . they stopped sending them out two years ago and we haven't heard anything since . we show up at their door step every month , yell terrible obscenities , ruin their " ceremonies " , and you're worried that they'll get op because he / she downloaded shit off the internet ? it's silly .

<TRNC> ran across a duplicate . most decks start in the same order , so there's a reasonably high chance that the first time you shuffle a deck you'll get something someone has gotten before . once you've shuffled it a couple of times , the chances of coming up with a deck someone has already seen is much lower . if i felt like it , i could come up with the probability of coming up with the same deck twice based on the assumptions above , but i think this has already gone on a little too long .

state creation is the only thing keeping nauru floating . they got $ <NUM>m to recognize china as the owner of taiwan , then they got $ <NUM>m from russia for ' recognizing ' abkhazia . they also recognized kosovo , but nobody bothered to send cash on that occasion . so if you declare a new state , nauru is there to recognize you .
so thats why the segway guy bought an island and made his own country recognize nations . profit . thats fucked up

<TRNC> i've glossed over a few things for brevity , but if you pull up a terminal , type in python then from random import random then copy and paste in the first block of code , then paste in the second block of code . the second block won't return for a while . once it does , type len to find out how many decks were generated before it found a duplicate . you could save it to a python source file and import that source file , but the repl is easy enough for something this short .

don't get me wrong , i love evolutionary psychology and epjournal.net is on my facebook . however , evolutionary psychologists love to find stuff . are there any examples in lower animals or primates that one individual vomiting invokes a response in others ? what about the many of us that don't care if someone vomits ? i know plenty of people like myself that aren't bothered by watching someone throw up . we'd all be poisoned and die . i'd like to know if it is the smell or sight that invokes the response the most .

now here's the real question : is the ability to ignore urge to vomit upon seeing someone else do so a separate evolved trait , or are you just desensitizing yourself over time ? i think you'd have to observe preschools and kindergartens to get a better idea . so , preschool and kindergarten teachers of reddit , * prepare to science * .

<TRNC> is a negation . ~ a means not a . ~ a → b means " if not a , then b . " ↔ means " if and only if " and is called a biconditional . a if and only if b . • is a conjunction . easy , a • b means a and b . those are the big ones for basic statement logic . so you can say statements like → this means " if a or b , then a and c . " that's your intro to statement logic right here .

<TRNC> fallacious because you're not reading it as " always q only whenever p . " it's tricky because this sort of statement doesn't have many realizations in the real world . it is incredibly rare for something to only have one path to realization in the real world , and we tend to assume multiple realizability , so these sorts of statements can trip us up . in fact , i dare someone to come up with an actual example of this argument . i can't think of one at the moment . edit : added in " only "

so much hate for scarborough - people should only be scared of malvern !
it is not wrong , actually . i should know because i am pursuing a master's in logic .
okay , i screwed up , it's not fallacious . what i meant to say was that it is not actually " proof by contraposition " , it is modus tolens . if you interpret the notation as representing proof by contraposition , then you must interpret the " direct proof " above as a tautology as opposed to representing modus ponens , which i assume was intended . as such i still think calling it ' wrong ' is accurate , although not fallacious . or am i still wrong ?

hi . calling modus tollens " proof by contraposition " is wrong , actually . you should know because you are pursuing a master's in logic .
i'm pretty sure that there are also some states that won't issue you a driver's license if you have not registered .
really , the registration is just a technicality . there is no draft anymore , and any politician that even had the balls to seriously mention it would probably find him or herself voted out on the next election cycle .

i think the only reason anyone signs up for that dumb law is so that they can be eligible for federal loans to go to school . from what i remember , if you weren't registered , you couldn't get any federally guaranteed money to go to college . i could be wrong , that's just what i remember .
from what i understand in [ this ] wikipedia article , that doesn't exclude you from the draft at all .
i don't think the wikipedia article is correct ; as far as i know you need to register before you turn <NUM> , not necessarily within <NUM> days of your <NUM>th bday . i registered shortly before i turned <NUM> and had no problems .
huh ? once you go into the military , you don't have to sign up for selective service . you do remain on inactive reserve , however .

meh . i don't think sanchez is as good a qb as anybody is already giving him credit for . at least not yet . a lot of his big plays are really sloppy passes that only get caught because braylon edwards is a crazy acrobat . i don't think he's particularly clever when i hear him talk , even as far as football players go . but the kid has heart , doesn't quit , and loves the game . i think that's commendable .
yet , no draft . starting wars is one thing , sending middle america's teenage sons to die as cannon fodder is another thing entirely .

i didn't even have to register normally . the town sent some volunteers to the school with forms to register seniors to vote , and i just checked a box that said " also register for the selective service " . it took longer to register for reddit .
i feel like reddit really sells this guy short for some reason , why would he go back to school after already making his money if not to better himself ? sure , maybe he didn't attend every single class personally , but i bet he took all the test on his own . he is even earning his doctorate at yale now . as far as i can infer he is just genially interested in experiencing as much of life as he can , whether through roles he decides to undertake or higher education .
