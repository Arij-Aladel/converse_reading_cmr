<title> drew brees planning to play out final year of contract in <NUM> | nola.com </title> <p> drew brees said monday that he plans to play out the final year of his contract with the new orleans saints in <NUM> . </p> <p> the <NUM> - year-old quarterback said he'll then consider his future one year at a time in order to put forth his " absolute best effort " toward winning the nfc south and a second super bowl title with new orleans . </p> <p> " listen , so i signed a one-year extension , so that was this year and then next year , " brees said . " and so i plan on playing that out and just allowing things to take form and take shape here for next year and putting forth my absolute best effort to help us win a division championship and then a world championship . </p> <p> " and then , again , just one year at a time , and that's not a lack of commitment or anything like that . it's just , i just want to focus on what's right in front of me . " </p> <p> brees spent much of last offseason discussing his contract before agreeing to an extension in september that prevented him from becoming a free agent until after the <NUM> season . </p> <p> brees is set to make $ <NUM> million for <NUM> , but there isn't much incentive for him to seek an extension compared to last year , when a new deal would've created salary cap space . brees was set to have a $ <NUM> million salary cap hit last season before the extension . a deal earlier in the offseason would've given the saints more money to woo free agents , but brees ' one-year extension still gave the team more cap room to make necessary moves during the <NUM> season . </p> <p> " i'm not concerned about because i think a big part of that was how can we creatively open cap space too for the team for us to be able to build what is going to be a great foundation and championship core moving forward , " brees said . " and we accomplished that with the deal last year at the beginning of this , so there's really nothing to be done at this point . " </p> <p> the saints finished <NUM><NUM> in <NUM> , but brees had another sensational season . he finished the year fifth in the nfl in passer rating , third in passing touchdowns and second in completion percentage . he also passed for a league-high <NUM> yards , marking the fifth time he's surpassed <NUM> yards in a season - - only four players have accomplished that feat and each did it once . </p> <p> now <NUM> years into his career , brees is still playing like one of the top quarterbacks in the nfl <TRNC>

<title> deicing fluid , the free encyclopedia </title> <p> ground deicing of aircraft is commonly performed in both commercial and general aviation . the fluids used in this operation are called deicing or anti-icing fluids . the abbreviations adf or aaf are commonly used . [ <NUM> ] </p> <p> deicing fluids come in a variety of types , and are typically composed of ethylene glycol or propylene glycol , along with other ingredients such as thickening agents , surfactants , corrosion inhibitors , and colored , uv-sensitive dye . propylene glycol - based fluid is more common due to the fact that it is less toxic than ethylene glycol . </p> <p> the society of automotive engineers publishes standards for four different types of aviation deicing fluids : </p> <p> the international organization for standardization publishes equivalent standards , defining the same four types . </p> <p> deicing fluids containing thickeners are also known as anti-icing fluids , because they are used primarily to prevent icing from re-occurring after an initial deicing with a type i fluid . </p> <p> the main component of deicing fluid is usually propylene glycol or ethylene glycol . other ingredients vary depending on the manufacturer , but the exact composition of a particular brand of fluid is generally held as confidential proprietary information . </p> <p> based on chemical analysis , the u . s . environmental protection agency has identified five main classes of additives widely used among manufacturers : [ <NUM> ] </p> <p> the use of <NUM>- propanediol as a base for deicing fluid was patented in <NUM> .

<title> butter </title> <p> butter is a solid dairy product made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk , to separate the butterfat from the buttermilk . it is generally used as a spread on plain or toasted bread products and a condiment on cooked vegetables , as well as in cooking , such as baking , sauce making , and pan frying . butter consists of butterfat , milk proteins and water . </p> <p> most frequently made from cows ' milk , butter can also be manufactured from the milk of other mammals , including sheep , goats , buffalo , and yaks . salt such as dairy salt , flavorings and preservatives are sometimes added to butter . rendering butter produces clarified butter or ghee , which is almost entirely butterfat . </p> <p> butter is a water-in-oil emulsion resulting from an inversion of the cream ; in a water-in-oil emulsion , the milk proteins are the emulsifiers . butter remains a solid when refrigerated , but softens to a spreadable consistency at room temperature , and melts to a thin liquid consistency at <NUM> – <NUM> ° c . the density of butter is <NUM> g / l . [ <NUM> ] </p> <p> it generally has a pale yellow color , but varies from deep yellow to nearly white . its unmodified color is dependent on the animals ' feed and is commonly manipulated with food colorings in the commercial manufacturing process , most commonly annatto or carotene . </p> <p> the word butter derives from the latin butyrum , [ <NUM> ] which is the latinisation of the greek βούτυρον . [ <NUM> ] [ <NUM> ] this may have been a construction meaning " cow-cheese " , from βοῦς , " ox , cow " [ <NUM> ] + τυρός , " cheese " , [ <NUM> ] but perhaps this is a false etymology of a scythian word . [ <NUM> ] nevertheless , the earliest attested form of the second stem , turos , is the mycenaean greek tu-ro , written in linear b syllabic script <TRNC> <p> in general use , the term " butter " refers to the spread dairy product when unqualified by other descriptors . the word commonly is used to describe puréed vegetable or seed and nut products such as peanut butter and almond butter . it is often applied to spread fruit products such as apple butter . fats such as cocoa butter and shea butter that remain solid at room temperature are also known as " butters " . in addition to the act of applying butter being called " to butter " , non-dairy items that have a dairy <TRNC> <p> unhomogenized milk and cream contain butterfat in microscopic globules . these globules are surrounded by membranes made of phospholipids and proteins , which prevent the fat in milk from pooling together into a single mass . butter is produced by agitating <TRNC>

<title> apple hits qualcomm with $ <NUM> billion lawsuit for being a patent troll </title> <p> apple just did the unthinkable : the tech giant is suing qualcomm , maker of the iphone's baseband processor — the smartphone's modem for connecting to mobile networks — to the tune of $ <NUM> billion . </p> <p> first reported by cnbc , the lawsuit portrays qualcomm as an extortionist over basic smartphone technology and accuses the san diego-based chip company of withholding payments to apple in " retaliation " for cooperating with investigators . </p> <p> apple's move is related to another legal action from earlier this week , when the ftc filed an antitrust lawsuit against qualcomm , alleging it was using its patents to strong-arm competitors into paying exorbitant patent royalties , even for devices that don't use qualcomm-made components . </p> <p> see also : the anti-trust lawsuit that could shape the future of smartphones </p> <p> apple was prominently named in the ftc lawsuit , which also alleges qualcomm pressured apple in specific ways to guarantee it would use its modem tech exclusively for a five-year period , from <NUM> to <NUM> . the agreement essentially shut out every other manufacturer of baseband processors from the world's most popular smartphone , which the lawsuit says unfairly hampered competitors ' development . </p> <p> apple casts qualcomm as a lazy company that no longer innovates because its business is built around " older , legacy technologies " </p> <p> in apple's statement about its own lawsuit , the company says qualcomm has been charging royalties " for technologies they have nothing to do with . " apple casts qualcomm as a lazy company that no longer innovates because its business is built around " older , legacy technologies " and that it collects many royalties " for no reason " — essentially accusing the chipmaker of being a patent troll . </p> <p> apple specifically accuses qualcomm of withholding " nearly $ <NUM> billion " in payments in an act of corporate revenge against apple , since it cooperated with " law enforcement agencies " tasked with investigating the chipmaker . those investigations are what likely led to the ftc lawsuit . </p> <p> apple also gave some detail on just how large qualcomm's royalties are . according to the company's statement , the royalties qualcomm collects on the iphone are five times those of the device's other " cellular patent licensors " combined . </p> <p> apple ’ s lawsuit offers a rare glimpse into the behind-the-scenes dealmaking around intellectual property that goes into building the world ’ s most popular tech products . while lawsuits over designs and patents happen occasionally , the world ’ s most valuable company going after one of its own partners , especially one as important to the iphone as qualcomm , was something few could have predicted . </p> <p> the lawsuit will certainly have reverberations in the wireless industry for <TRNC>

" this can be targeted with an unauthenticated remote code exploit . once you ’ re within the network from this point , you can pivot onto the dlp box . " </p> <p> as for the basic weaknesses , one was an unauthenticated stored cross-site scripting flaw , where it was possible to execute malicious javascript code as an administrator of the affected technology . this is typically done by sending a link to a target and forcing them to run that code , though not required in this case as an attacker could wait until an administrator logged into the application and execute their code directly on the server . </p> <p> in the case of the trend weakness , once executed , the code would grant the attacker control of the targeted server , allowing a hacker to grab whatever data was inside or change what the service did . it's " the worst type " of xss , one of the most common vulnerabilities on the web , said seeley , who declined to name the affected technology as trend is working on a fix .
