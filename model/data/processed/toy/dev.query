harvard is well endowed

so ... when is the revolution ?
having worked in the admissions office of my college . a school can meet the strict definition of being need-blind while still waitlisting students b / c they can't afford to let in any more scholarship students . i had some very interesting discussions with one of the admissions officers on this matter , she hated it but it was just a fact of life . however , i'm very proud to say that my alma mater guarantees that anyone who does get in will be able to pay for their schooling .
so where does the money go ? really curious to know

<TRNC> top <NUM> % of uk students . finally , i'm under the impression that almost every student applying to any university in the us takes the sat which is very different to as levels and so your sat score acts as a measure of your intelligence compared to all students looking to go to university , rather than just the students interested in the same subject as you . weighting your comparison using this i don't think it's true at all that just being in the top <NUM> % of your year would guarantee entry to oxford or cambridge .

how the rich stay rich y'all . what a beautiful system .
well , public universities in germany legally cannot charge tuition beside a nominal administrative fee for international or domestic students . this is anecdotal , but a friend of mine goes to uni in denmark and she is paid a stipend as well as provided housing . she is danish though .
harvard makes so much money from the interest on its endowment that even if the school gave free tuition to all of its students it would still make a profit
<TRNC> farmers , farmers are generally not business savvy or educated . they may own <NUM> acres , but be barely scraping a living . they see an llc as something rich folk do to avoid paying taxes and associate with something only dishonest people do . and when they get their taxes done and the account suggests establishing an llc , all they see is what they would have to pay a lawyer and think it's a scam . so while it makes perfect sense to have an llc , almost none of the farmers i know have one .

harvard has incredibly aggressive aid packages . they basically only charge the very wealthy their tuition and fees , and they can afford it anyway . spending the capital of the endowment or even taking out large amounts of the growth is a very shortsighted thinking .

<TRNC> students scored above the <NUM>th percentile . * * there are about <NUM> high schools in the us , meaning there are at least * * <NUM> valedictorians in the country * * harvard's accepted incoming class is around <NUM> students . so yeah , you really need to do something amazing , because even if * * only * * students scoring <NUM>th + on the sat applied , the acceptance rate would still only be <NUM> percent . that's not even counting international students . tl ;D r : it's really fucking hard to get into harvard .
<TRNC> there are no poors at all , " but it's a never ending rabbit hole of policy . to a small degree the graduate schools are the great equalizer : a degree from hls , hbs , or hms is going to cost you so much you either are uber wealthy and can pay , or you're in the same boat of <NUM>k + in loans anyway . i used to date a legacy hms grad and while her family comes from means , they're not * rich * , and she has the same loans as everyone else .
i hope you're not taking about the border cafe as crappy , that restaurant is one of my favorite places to go
that's not a lot more expensive than europe . iirc , britain's average student loan debt is very similar to ours . idk how the rest of the eu compares .
i know plenty of middle class people at harvard that pay full sticker . the financial aid dept is actually extremely strict and if you don't fit their specific criteria for aid , even if you deserve it , tough shit . i don't know why people propagate the myth that they're super lenient but they're really not .
africa actually had a number of functional states prior to colonization .
three types of folks are accepted into harvard : scholars , donors children , and athletes . the undergraduate program is also highly overrated due to their grade inflation . gotta keep mommy and daddy writing those big checks . their grad schools top notch though and are where they make serious money .
i'm honestly shocked that <NUM> + percentile and perfect grades isn't enough to guarantee entry into harvard . in the uk my application to cambridge talked almost exclusively about academic achievements and interests and then i devoted maybe a line or two to non-academic stuff . i think a <NUM> % average in your as levels would guarantee you entry unless you badly bombed the interview . it's weird that you need to have done something " amazing "

i hate this argument . yes , in some circumstances rich people get off too easily , but how do you think technology advances ? is someone from a poverty area gonna develop the next cure for cancer or rocket to mars ? it's a good thing we give money to educate the people who are the type that will use that cost to advance the world .
tip for all internationals . the only <NUM> fully need blind us unis are : amherst college mit harvard yale princeton these five are need blind for internationals , thus you needing aid wont harm your app . hope this gets visibility . i eded to amherst and won this year and i hope that other people apply to these <NUM> .
what's an incredibly aggressive aid package ? are they like " take this free money you f * ck ! ! ! "
ugh , i really wish i wasnt the first person from my family to go to college . i didnt know much of anything , and went to a small university because i wasnt sure my family and any financial aid i got was going to be able to afford anything bigger . oh well , work with what i got and help my younger siblings out in anyway i can . glad the bigger schools are doing this to help the next generation .
<TRNC> i talked about in the later comment who tried to play ' ohhh harvard ' in front of very rich lawyers and bankers would likely face palm when remembering the story . i've got lots of friends that went to prestigious schools . lots that went to garbage schools . lots that didn't go to school . i've got friends that are filthy rich and dirt poor . i'm at the point in my life where in career you're judged by your ability to excel in the job . in personal life it's about people whose company i enjoy .
so what should the judge have done that wouldn't have indirectly fucked over his kids ?

<TRNC> dealer friends and they're buying tables , popping bottles and flossing on everyone while you're thinking about deadlines you've got to meet and how you're paying rent at the end of the month . university was the easy part . e : to people that are saying i'm lying , why the fuck would i lie about this , if i was gonna lie i'd say i skipped school and now i'm a bottle popping drug dealer . there's nothing cool about grinding school for <NUM> years and having nothing to show for it but a mountain of debt .
<TRNC> wait , what ? what do you think tuition pays for ? it pays for the costs of running the school , everything from staff salaries to printer paper . where do you think this money comes from at other schools ?
stanford doesn't charge tuition if you make under $ <NUM>k a year , and you get free room and board if your family makes under $ <NUM>k a year .

check out malcolm gladwell's podcast called revisionist history . in episode " my little hundred million " he makes a compelling case that rich people shouldn't donate to harvard , stanford , princeton , i . e schools with large endowments . they can afford tuition for their students without getting close to the principal of the endowment . instead , large gifts by the wealthy are better put to use at smaller local colleges that can really use the money more effectively .

" at least trump seems very pragmatic when it comes to his understanding of military matters in that he has already been vocal about the idiocy of revealing military strategy .
that's where the expression comes from .
i love your dismissal of me as a stupid person as a convenient scapegoat for you because you obviously didn't think your comment would go anywhere because like mine , it was pointless . you wasted your time by having the condescension to reply to my comment . i don't understand people who feel the need to rectify every insignificant thing they see , it's an un-winnable war . you literally did nothing to change my opinion . as you can see my comment is still up and you're still unjustified .

<TRNC> but the problem was that model sent into combat was defective and just didn't * work * most of the time , and the torpedoes themselves would consistently run too deep and pass under the target by a distance too great to set off . despite overwhelming testimony by submarine captains that suspected there to be an issue , the bureau of ordinance ignored these reports , citing human error to be at fault . it took two years to resolve these issues of malfunctioning torpedoes , and probably cost the service as many lives at the above congressman .

this seemed like a bigger deal at the time than it ultimately turned out to be . john stewart and stephen colbert hid behind the comedy veil , but were always activists at heart , as we can see from their post-comedy central careers . journalists no longer pretend to be neutral , and tucker has found a lot of success in the years since by being openly an opinioned commentator and attracting both fans and detractors .
the reason things like this happen is purely pride i feel . same thing with today , people refuse to see the other side of any story . same reason why the heliocentric theory was deemed blasphemy , how dare they say we aren't the center of the universe ? ? pride and greed is the bane of human existence .

this was one of boris's primary pledges as mayor . he said he would reintroduce the big diesel burning buses despite the pollution they caused and deal with the regulatory requirements by installing water sprays around the detectors to catch pollution . he did both . this is all boris , livingstone made quite a bit of progress of improving london's transport system and reducing pollution from vehicles , boris reintroduced smog to the capital . the politicians you choose matter .
solar is the best but whatevs dude : ^ )

at this rate it'll only take til <NUM> for them to stop passing the limit altogether .
<TRNC> two of the most polluted roads in europe ! it's all the buses / taxis / service vehicles running off diesel that does it . i don't think there's anything that can be done about it except wait for self driving cars + electric vehicles to become mainstream . london's going to be a much nicer place to live once that happens . will be able to design the city for people , not cars . there's nothing stopping suburbs from starting this process now , but areas with major through roads are obviously a lot trickier to handle .
question from someone who doesn't pay enough attention to european politics . is this related at all to brexit ? were the people in favor of brexit , like those in favor of trump , conservative climate change deniers and corporate wonks who wish to do away with regulations ? is this a bipeoduct of that decision or is this completely unrelated ?
it's funny - i look at how london has developed over the last ten years and i honestly can't think of a single meaningful thing mr johnson accomplished as mayor . the city seems to be an increasing difficult place for ordinary londoners to live in - in many different ways . the olympics and boris bikes : that's pretty much his legacy as mayor . the man is a terrible politician when it comes to actually getting anything done - he's making a horrible mess of the brexit negotiations even as we speak .
so the article states : > " brixton road in lambeth has already broken legal limits for toxic air for the entire year " but does not go on to say anything about fines , repercussions etc ... so it sounds like while " legal " limits have been broken , there is no downside for doing so ? therefore it doesn't take anyone too smart to figure out that they'll continue to do this .
last year they only made it to <NUM> days . this gets posted every fucking year . and no they won't stop .
because only conservatives care about cash . jesus fuck i hate the political circlejerk here
we did it , london ! we broke another record ! lambeth down ! more to come ! pollution truly is the gift that never stops giving . so many records to break ... so little time !

in <NUM> , jon stewart went on cnn's tv show crossfire and criticized hosts tucker carlson and paul begala for the partisan and sensationalized nature of the show . the show was cancelled next year , with the president of cnn citing and agree with many of stewart's points .
yeah , but it's a slightly misleading methodology , especially with that headline , since an ' annual air pollution limit ' would intuitively be a limit on the amount of pollution you can produce in a year , which suggests that they are producing around <NUM>x more pollution than the limit , rather than being a bit over the limit quite often
didn't he burn cities and people . that has to have put some carbon back in the environment .
that the destruction under genghis khan may have scrubbed as much as <NUM> million tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere by allowing forests to regrow on previously populated and cultivated land .
so essentially , what this means is that it spent more than <NUM> hours over the target . it's not like it's produced a year's worth of pollution in that time , just that the targets allow a certain number of hours that exceed the target .
now if london could just follow suit .

you are correct . its worth highlighting that the target is not meant to be exceeded for more than <NUM> times over the length of <NUM> year from january <NUM>st to december <NUM>st . meaning in <NUM> it has taken <NUM> days and <NUM> hours to already breach the target . this is nothing new though , last year putney high street broke the limit <NUM> times and in <NUM> oxford street <NUM> times .

<TRNC> the ending of the <NUM> charlton heston movie version . in the first of two twist endings of the pierre boulle book , the astronaut escapes back to planet earth , only to be greeted by a gorilla in a jeep on the landing strip . burton claimed the ending was not supposed to make any sense , but it was more of a cliffhanger to be explained in a possible sequel . " it was a reasonable cliffhanger that could be used in case fox or another filmmaker wanted to do another movie , " he explained . )
the jeep is a gorilla ? ! woah .
i'm no expert , and please correct me if i'm wrong , but wouldn't pollution be transferred from air to water ? " our drinking water tastes funny - but at least we can breathe again ? "
nobody gives a shit about that , what about the * money * ?
the ending of tim burton's ' planet of the apes ' confused even its actors . tim roth said " i cannot explain that ending . i have seen it twice and i don't understand anything . " burton said that it was an intentional cliffhanger , not supposed to make any sense , to allow a sequel .
i remember kevin smith griping about burton ripping this ending off him from a comic he did . tim burton replied along the lines of " i don't even read comics ! " to which smith replied " yeah , i could tell with how batman turned out ... " edit : batman not bateman

that would be cool if nim chimpsy and noam chomsky smoked weed and signed together !

is it just my misperception or does dutch sound more like english than , say , german ?
just out of curiosity , as a dancer myself i'm wondering how one could ever be " permanently too weak " . she would have to work hard to retrain her muscles but i wouldn't think you could be too weak forever unless you were terminally ill . could somebody who knows more about this explain why this was the case for her ? edit : i learned a lot about malnutrition's effect on development . thanks guys ! ! !

<TRNC> if it was advertised as a regular sci-fi movie . i mean , they need huge rocket boosters to leave earth's gravity , but then to leave a planet where there was such a huge gravity well that time passes thousands of times slower , the ship's small thrusters were perfectly ok . not to mention the wormhole thing , the being that close to a supermassive blackhole without any time dilation thing , etc . it's like they were going for a scientifically accurate movie , and one hour into filming they just said " fuck it " .

it's sad isn't it . it is my hope that one day , we'll be able to make a faster than light something or other . maybe a ship that has the ability to not actually move faster than light , but to bend space so that two places are actually one ... aaaannnnd i've just invented the event horizon , and i've opened a portal to hell .
that was the exact same feeling i had about the movie . they started off good then progressively stopped giving a fuck until we arrived at the power of love conquering physics , at which point there were no fucks left . the ending time paradox was just a nice little cherry on top . spoiler : humans survive because they are contacted by future humans who are themselves , but that never happened originally <TRNC>
atmospheric pressure is a big factor as well . a planet with higher gravity than earth but with a thin enough atmosphere could be * easier * to take off from than earth as there's considerably less drag
but doesn't love always transcend physics in our hearts ?
not to be confused with [ rip torn ] . most of the wormhole stuff he's involved with has to do with acid and meth .
i wonder what is more unlikely : reddit still existing in <NUM> or mankind has found a way to travel faster than light by <NUM> .
the concept of relativity comes into effect here . nothing can move beyond the speed of light relative to another object to some observer . thus , if something were to seem to move faster , then time dilation happens , " preventing " the break in the speed limit .

isn't it hilarious ? some people think they can fly like birds ! buwahhahahaahah preposterous .
in reality , the final black hole you see in the movie isn't <NUM> % accurate . the truly realistic render was too complicated and nolan thought it would confuse audiences too much . so instead they simplified it quite a bit . you can read more about it [ here ]
i'd say this is a bit of an outlier . i'm a scientist who sits on a lot of funding committees and some people think that throwing more money at a problem can solve it . generally it's not . you need people who can think very deeply about a problem and ask the right question . don't get me wrong though , money does help !
if nobody really knows , how can you say it wasn't <NUM> % accurate 🤔
i'm really interested to see if any of our widely accepted laws of nature will turn out to be completely wrong in the future . i tend to think the scientific method makes that impossible though . obviously minutia of theories will always be changing and growing , but i wonder if anything will be completely invalidated and tossed into the history books along with humors , a geocentric solar system , and aristole's classical elements .
<TRNC> . > from the wired piece and others , thorne said , " it sounded like what we found dealt with the apparent shape of the accretion disk , when it actually has to do with gravitational lensing patterns of stars behind the black hole .

actually , with sufficiently large black holes , spaghettification is not an issue until well inside the event horizon .
yes falling into a suerpmassive black hole , not being ripped apart even though planets and stars couldn't survive it , but a human is absolutely fine . not to mention managing to escape even though light itself cannot escape , and surviving with apparently no negative effects afterwards . someone travelling faster than light seems an odd thing to nit pick about given everything else they manage to do .
kip thorne is that sort of a guy .
given the black hole has a sufficiently large schwarzschild radius , it's possible to reach the event horizon without being ripped apart by tidal effects
> you mean if you fall into a black hole , you don't go to the <NUM>th dimension ? you do , but it's called " the secret cow level "
year <NUM> : " til in the year <NUM> , scientists talked film directors from having movie characters travel faster than light because * they didn't think it was possible * . "

thank you ! vegan would be my next step , but i'll probably try just cutting out meat first and see how it goes . and yes , eating out is one thing i'm worried about . me and my friends tend to eat out <NUM><NUM> times per week , and i live in kansas :/ not very vegetarian / gluten free friendly ' round these parts . i just keep imagining what i would normally order , then what all would need to be taken away for my diet to work the way i want it to .
aren't vegan and vegetarian same ?
<TRNC> know what was happening ? they should have known about the gravitational lensing and thus the delay in the messages from the surface ? why such bad info ? <NUM> ) ugh there was another one but i can't remember now and my timer is about to go off and kick me off . edit : i remember the <NUM>rd one and even neil degrasse tyson mentioned it . the wall of water ? on the water planet apparently a form of tides ? that is not how tides work at all . not a wall , a bulge .

<TRNC> of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the artists , who then wrote new cgi rendering software based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena . some individual frames took up to <NUM> hours to render , totalling to <NUM> terabytes of data for the movie . the resulting visual effect provided thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes , which led to the publication of three scientific papers this proves that with more funding we could know so much more already .

he's also been heavily involved in supporting and assisting <NUM>/<NUM> responders in getting their health coverage expanded by congress , among other things . i truly miss seeing him every night , but knowing he's involved in various charitable causes as well as expanding the farm for abused animals keeps me going .
think of a wormhole as more of a shortcut to get somewhere faster instead of speed . so you could get from point a to b " faster than light " , but your actual speed was never " faster than light "
if his movies are cancer does that mean movie critics are chemo ?
i honestly think people complain about anything . i was glued to the screen for the whole movie , and i found it pretty emotional ... loved it , it was something different . people complain about sequels and reboots , but also complain about more original ideas ... you just can't win !

he was good in several films . and there are plenty of actors who turn in a mixed quality of performance over their career without getting shat on by reddit . the difference is that he did a lot of super pretentious art stuff a few years back that made him into a joke .
you don't have to go full vegetarian or vegan to make a difference . having meatless monday's adds up and makes a big difference .
<TRNC> animal population decrease , suffering and extinction through habitat loss . crops and palm oil . edit : i will explain now i have an access to a computer . all this veganism , vegetarianism , philanthropy and other bs is just for show . the only way to save our planet is to cut human population numbers in at least half and freeze them there . for as long as human population is growing with the rates it is growing now - nothing can help save this planet or its animals . so cut this populist bullshit guys .
you're implying the animal slaughtered has what would be considered " wants . "

thats weird that he is a vegitarian because he was an avid arbys customer who ordered a double ruben , with no kraut , and spicy brown mustard . i know this because when he was leaving the daily show arbys had a secret menu item in memorium of jon . so this might be incorrect .

he actually came up with the idea for the movie back in <NUM> and spent <NUM> years working on it , with several different directors and writers before christopher nolan . check out his book [ the science of interstellar ] , it's full of information about the physics in the movie and the production of it .
[ here he is petting one of his rescued pigs . ]
not all art should be for sub average consumers .
that's nothing . he actually used to have his own show on comedy central .
they farm abused animals ? ? that's pretty fucked up .
yep , there's a lot of calories in meat , unless you eat a boatload of sugary things it is very hard to overeat on vegetarian diet .
[ here he is petting one of his rescued pigs :) ]
lot of people in my family are vegetarian , and i could make the transition to vegetarian relatively easily as well , but not one of them would be able to go vegan . dairy is central to a lot of cuisine , honey is very useful , and eating out becomes a pain i the ass , especially if you live nowhere near a metropolitan area . edit : no idea why what i said is controversial , any <NUM> downvoting me care to explain ?

most of the coral in japan's largest coral reef are dead , and the rest are dying
<TRNC> a black hole . under our current understanding of physics , that's it , once you are past the event horizon you're done interacting with the outside universe until the black hole evaporates many billions , trillions , quadrillions of years later . you don't cease to exist though , and if the black hole is big enough you can actually survive this transition as the tidal forces aren't yet strong enough to obliterate you . so , if there is anywhere a hard scifi story can take liberties , it's the area where our scientific knowledge breaks down .
> vegetarian > perfect man so close
<TRNC> with supermassive black holes . an astronaut could theoretically survive past the event horizon , still alive while falling toward the centre , but as you say , will eventually die of tidal forces getting too powerful . in other words : you die well _before_ entering a <NUM> - solar-massed black hole , but you die well _after_ entering a <NUM>- solar-massed black hole . in theory , you could live out the rest of your natural life inside of a sufficiently sized black hole , falling toward the centre all the while . e : fucked up terms
coming from / r / all , interested in going veggie , what practical resources / recipes do you suggest ?
the theory that things called " germs " might be making us sick is only about <NUM> years old . for tens of thousands of years we were basically chalking it up to bad luck or witchcraft or the weather .
mostly the people who criticize it talk about the tesseract bookcase , the " magic of love " , and that they thought it was too predictable . i've heard about equal criticism from when it came out till now but it's usually these same reasons . i find all three of these reasons to be especially strange and often wonder if these people even * like * movies .
a few people here are missing the breaking bad reference , it seems ?
<TRNC> adviser for the core is often maligned for the abysmal science in that movie . he had spent long arguments prevent " magma space suits " and a windshield for their drill to the centre of the earth . or brian cox , who was the science adviser for sunshine . thanks to him the movie was pretty realistic with it's depiction of space travel , apart from the premise of using a bomb to restart the sun . when the directer has an idea in their head , it's very hard for the science adviser to stop it .
i am neither a vegan or a vegetarian but i give props to anyone who walks the walk .
that implies that people usually eat meat every day . is that generally true ? i never really made an effort to limit my meat intake i naturally don't eat meat on most days of the week and i thought my diet was pretty average .
i wish i could be a vegetarian but i think i might only eat cheesy potatoes .
pet me , jon .
the scientific adviser to the <NUM> film interstellar spent two weeks talking christopher nolan out of having a character travelling faster than the speed of light , as it defies the laws of physics
you're making me feel pretty bad for eating meat . i live in los angeles . i have like <NUM> vegetarian restaurant options within walking distance . and produce is hella cheap .
<TRNC> about the science of interstellar , and mentioned that the tesseract was actually portrayed in a way that makes sense with respect to the physics behind it , with the caveat that it would have to be constructed by beings who live in the fifth dimension . he went on to say that the only part of the movie he would consider <NUM> % inaccurate and impossible would be the wormhole tunnel ; apparently , according to the latest work he's done , travelling through the wormhole would be instantaneous , and the tunnel was added for dramatic effect .
<TRNC> hard sci-fi , that's also awesome although there are very few truely hard sci-fi movies . because it doesn't usually make for a good script . magic and fantasy in tv / movies is brilliant . want to cast a spell to make a dragon appear ? i'm totally with you . want to crank your spaceship up to warp <NUM> to go vanquish some alien motherfuckers who just happen to walk on two legs and speak english ? sweet ! but sciency-magic dressed up as hard sci-fi does my head in . totally breaks my suspension of disbelief .
oh yeah , that was me . want some proof ? e = mc ^ <NUM> . need more proof ? i guarantee you that it's not physically possible for someone to travel faster than the speed of light .
i've been thinking about going at least vegetarian , but i have a super hard time getting enough protein already . i'm already underweight and can't afford to lose more . is pescatarian looked down on by the vegan and vegetarian communities ? edit : i'm sick as a dog today so sorry for not responding to every comment , but everyone has been super helpful . i've got a lot more research to do and a lot of you even did it for me ! fuck what people say , y'all are a nice bunch .
<TRNC> the logical conclusion of the story . they need to solve a gravity equation to get off of earth , to be able to control gravity . they succeed . as time passes and humans then become more and more advanced , it is theoretical that we could ascend to become beings of <NUM>th dimension . being beings of the <NUM>th dimension , the first thing they will need to do is to succeed in their initial problem of solving the gravity equation . therefore , create the bookcase tesseract for coop . it all makes sense to me .
you mean if you fall into a black hole , you * don't * go to the <NUM>th dimension ?
why would anyone shitpost on your for this comment ?
sunshine is an awesome movie though . i'm happy for a few silly things to get by as long as they don't take the piss with it
<TRNC> super hero film meant to milk the wallet teet of people all around the world . edit : i just want to add that i loved the film , saw the early screening in <NUM>mm imax and it was such an awesome experience . haven't had that much fun at the movies since i was a kid and nolan always does that for me . i'll see anything he puts out - i believe it to be consistent quality . edit <NUM> : thank you to whoever gilded me . i appreciate that . i will return the favor !

i dunno why him or stephen colbert don't honestly try and run sometime in the future . i mean , it's not like they are less qualified than the current president-elect .
i think most people who saw it liked it . it certainly got positive reviews , and if you go back to threads when it first came out the majority of people enjoyed it . now that its a couple years later most people commenting on posts about interstellar are probably people who didn't like the movie . i typically think of threads like this as an example of the vocal minority .

<TRNC> about the meat industry you could cut meat out of your diet once or twice a week . if you don't care about animals / the meat industry you could think of other ways to eat ethically . maybe for <NUM> meals a week you could eat entirely locally . or maybe you could cut out fruits and vegetables that were harvested by underpaid farm workers . i think the most important thing is to just think about your food and where it comes from , and to try to eat in a way that makes you feel ethical .

<TRNC> for meat for me and my dogs and cats is ecologically unsustainable ? i feed my chickens collards , kale , broccoli , millet , wheat , turnip and mustard greens , tomatoes , squash , melons , blueberries , strawberries and purslane from my garden , and mealworms i raise with a fortified meal . i sell the purebred chicks and eggs and turn the cockerels into meat for me and the cats and dogs . i put all the chicken feces into a compost pile that i later put on the garden to feed the next crop .

<TRNC> benign essential tremor . i have an " essential tremor " and found it hard not to laugh as a doctor explained to me that , while he certainly wouldn't recommend alcohol , he had heard from other doctors who dealt with patients who had it , and that he definitely under no circumstances could possibly recommend it , alcohol could help . not that he would recommend that or anything . * " nudge nudge i'm legally and professionally unable to recommend wink wink that alcohol can help .

i finally got around to listening to hardcore history , and it really helped to visualize just how hellish these " battles " were . imagine a wasteland where there are literally tens of thousands of corpses piled anywhere you can see . anytime you have to advance through this place you have to step over bodies , many of whom you might recognize . bodies in varying states of decomposition after months of meatgrinder like warfare .

> " werbeniuk died of heart failure on <NUM> january <NUM> , six days after his <NUM>th birthday . " shocking .
twice the size , organs that never kept growing . your organs start to get extremely fucked up when they reach their capacity to process alcohol , not when they are processing alcohol . scurrosis of the liver is basically caused by chronic , over capacity drinking . if you're drinking at a rate below what your body is capable of processing , you can keep going with little ill short term effects . over that limit for <NUM> hours straight ? your organs are going to be pissed , damaged and exhausted .
i , for one , honestly * * don't * * understand why this song was picked for * the man in the high castle * ' s intro . in * the sound of music * , the song was used as an act of austrian defiance against the nazis . the flower isn't native to north america , so how could it be used to represent american defiance against the nazi occupation ? and it certainly couldn't have been a german / nazi patriotic theme , meant to convey the nazification of the usa .
it's coincidental that it happens around the age of <NUM><NUM> or whatever , but i've talked to plenty of moderate to heavy drinkers that say the same thing : hangovers were trivial , then a switch almost got flipped and you feel hungover and you have crippling anxiety . yay ! i also got better at drinking in my <NUM>s and hangovers weren't as severe . then i hit <NUM> and my body just said " i am so sick of your faggotry , here's a panic attack every time you do this to me .

<TRNC> glasses of neat whisky . she asked how i felt afterwards and i said buzzed . she then asked if i was drunk or just okay , i replied i was usually okay . she then told me they use that as a gauge to determine how much anesthesia they would use to put me under . it seemed really unscientific but she said it's a similar mechanism to determine baseline non addictive tolerance to chemicals . i passed out when they put it in and i woke up after the procedure with no ill effects so * shrug *
the secret is to slowly the raise the amount you drink every night over the course of years . tolerance is a real thing . i'm <NUM> and i can drink <NUM> beers and just have a good buzz going . that being said , i'm thinking about seeking help for my drinking <TRNC>

<TRNC> attack . that's what happened to andre the giant , well and the fact his organs never stopped growing from acromegaly . he was famously known for * never * letting people pay for meals , mostly because he ate and drank so much he'd feel bad if someone else paid . on the average he'd consume <NUM> <NUM>oz beers , there's been stories of <NUM> beers plus <NUM><NUM> bottles of wine . the only substantiated stories were <NUM> beers or so , not saying he couldn't drink more , but that was the consensus . want a peanut ?
you are . alcohol causes dehydration as the kidneys are extracting more fluid from your blood to remove the toxin .
i know this is off topic but i can't get over how the german part of north america is called the greater nazi reich . " nazi " was a derogatory term . the nazis would never call their country the greater nazi reich . what's worse is in the first or second episode , a closeup of a german id card says , in german , " großdeutsches reich " - " greater german reich . " why not just call it that in english ?

are you joking ? it's uncommon these days , but doctors can and do prescribe heroin , cocaine , and methamphetamine in this country . you think ethics boards have a problem with alcohol , but not the hardest of hard drugs * so long as they are medically appropriate to prescribe * ?
oooh , and that's a bad miss .
<TRNC> liver was also in fine shape . the doctors could not make sense of it except to say that some folks have livers that can tolerate the abuse far better than others . that was <NUM> years ago when he died so they may have answers other than magic liver . i was told my liver was fine but if i kept drinking some of my other necessary organs were not going to make it and therefore neither was i . the spectre of imminent death is an excellent motivator to sober the hell up for lots of us .

rowan atkinson truly is a man of many talents . i knew about his driving skills , and now this . then there's this epic one , which is my personal favorite : > atkinson suffers from a stammer , and the over-articulation of ' b ' is a technique to overcome problematic consonants . one of his better-known comic devices is the same over-articulation of the " b " sound , such as his pronunciation of " bob " in the blackadder ii episode " bells " .

right . but do we need money lending to create them . i'm not being mocking . i'm just asking you to think about the questions by asking them . people create businesses because they think they can make a profit for themselves providing a product or service . which , if the product or service is good , is good for everyone . they get an income , society gets a good service . so why can't they just create businesses ?
it's not uncommon now for that to take place with just cash , no purchase involved , except for the advanced cash ' purchase ' . it's bundled [ the principle amount plus interest ] together , so it's a work-around in their minds . i think loopholes don't work with deities , but that's just like my opinion man .
> its funny , the jews are thought to be in control of the banks and all that shit , but the only reason jewish people got involved with banking is because christians ~ ~ refused to ~ ~ [ were prohibited by their religion ] . when you use the word " refused to " , you make it sound like a choice - - as in " those christians weren't willing to do the work , but then they get mad when other people get the reward !

it is also why we now have islamic banking in many places that tries to offer the same services as interest based banking in a way that conforms to religious prohibition of interest . they seem to do so mostly by relabeling things .
that the wwii-era bren gun was initially " too accurate " and not suitable for suppressive uses
the way around this , from my experience of arab banking , is to pay a facility for the loan . i . e . you pay the lender to ' rent ' the money from them . obviously it's the same as paying interest , it's just semantics .

not officially . at best it was an overly casual nickname . especially later on many nazis didn't have a problem with the term informally , but it would never have been used for anything official . actually as a german i often find it slightly jarring how the term is used in serious contexts in english . to me " nazi germany " is about on par with " commie russia " in terms of formality .
a while back when you wanted to change your character name in wow but they didn't have the pay to change feature , i got a tip from a friend who was a gm there . you'd post your characters name as a really offensive slang term on urban dictionary , then have another friend report you as offensive . the gms would search online for your name if it wasn't obvious and one of the tools they used was urban dictionary . they'd see it , then force you to change your name .
yep , usury was illegal for christians in europe for hundreds and hundreds of years . its how the jewish people got their reputation as bankers , they were the only ones in europe who could do it . its funny , the jews are thought to be in control of the banks and all that shit , but the only reason jewish people got involved with banking is because christians refused to .

<TRNC> who is the slightest bit cynical or macabre . that same cynical person would make a comment like yours sarcastically because it would seem so obvious to them and that type of person has a tendency to make others feel bad when they point out the obvious . then again to people with a more optimistic outlook on life . suicide simply isn't considered as cavalierly . i could see genuinely not getting that's what the poet meant simply because you wouldn't consider suicide , especially not as some consideration that actually has a positive influence on your emotions .

they said they're shifting the advertising to appeal more the christian conservative groups , rather than the original art-house campaign . if that's the case , it may open up more in the south and mid-size midwest cities . i think oscar nominations may help too--if it gets any major nods , they'll probably put it in a few more theaters .

canada's government is vehemently against self-defense . i see lots of people recommending that you keep a bat at home over getting a firearm , because you will be safer legally defending yourself with that . the law is actually that the ownership of any item strictly for personal defense is entirely illegal , which is ridiculous when you think about it .

did he ever think about getting his back removed so it would stop getting injured
bah gawd that's heffernan's music ! ! !
actor kevin james was the number one spot on his high school wrestling team , until he had a season ending back injury . his friend took over his place and became wwe star mick foley .
when you see mick foley s daughter , it all makes sense . [ ]
that oxygen is magnetic
and that's why jr was the best commentator the wwf / e ever had . dude was raw emotion in the high profile matches and could sell you on anything that happened . and when he actually thinks a guy is dead ? the man creates classics .
yeah kevin james is a real piece of shit , he pumped me full of viagra and made me fuck a dog .
number one spot = varsity at his weight class and foley was the jv spot
most definitely . i have a friend that went to mass in vegas of all places and james was at the same service . after mass they chatted briefly outside and he said james was super cool and gracious . had nothing but nice things to say about him .
just to add , [ harry patch was the last surviving combat soldier of ww<NUM> ] . my uncle used to see him a lot as an old people nurse .

hopefully , it'll get those eugenics people to think before they bring the subject up again . but i won't hold my breath ...

<TRNC> have back pain , the doctor shouldn't challenge whether you have pain or not . the doctor also cannot run a test to see if you have pain . when you go to a doctor , be it medical or psychological , the assumption should be that the patient is telling the truth . a hypochondriac might loose that privilige , but not on the first or second visit . diagnosing the <NUM> patients based on their account of symptoms was the right thing to do . starting to look for fake patients was the wrong thing to do .

where are you meeting these nutty psychologists / psychiatrists ? serious question , not being facetious . i'm a student going into the field , and have met nothing but upstanding reputable people . even in personal experience outside of academia and volunteer work , nothing out of the ordinary for a medical professional . so i'm wondering if maybe it's a location or certain area of practice that leads to nutty drugged out doctors ?

> usually people get into mental health to deal with their own shit . that's spot on . i had a pretty bad drug problem , after i was clean i started working at rehabs / mental wards , almost * all * of my co-workers had the same story as me . other weird thing , one ward i worked in all the staff including myself was left handed . over half the patients were lefties , i've always heard left handed people being called crazy smart . well , that's literally true , crazy and smart .
nice article on the tuck rule , and the beginnings of the patriots dynasty
what about people with metal in them from surgery ? i would assume it's not strong enough to take those out .
<TRNC> . this is actually a classic study in psychology , and it displayed how unreliable certain diagnostic criteria can be , which has led to reforms in manuals such as the [ dsm ] . that's not to say the study didn't have issues - the participants were told to say they had specific symptoms of schizophrenia , so it's no surprise they were diagnosed ; if you go into a hospital complaining of severe stomach pain saying you just swallowed metal , they're going to do emergency surgery . they of course don't expect you to be lying .
maybe it has something to do with the extremely high rate of violent crime in the black community .
my biggest fear would be being one of the hypothetical " sane " patients they send to the psychiatric hospital and nobody remembering to get me back out . a bit like the prison in the film face off
<TRNC> ed going " i need oxy " are treated with a bit of skepticism . besides , chronic opioid use can even worsen pain , by an effect called hyperalgesia . on a side note . if you're in pain and go to the er , don't say it's <NUM>/<NUM> , unless it really is . my next question is always " do you want something for pain " , i'm not gonna ignore you if you say <NUM> or <NUM> . don't lie to me . <NUM>/<NUM> is for brain hemorrhages , kidney stones , and perforated bowels .
mri questionnaire # <NUM> : do you have * * any * * piercings on your body that we don't know about ? * if you only answer one question correctly that day . let it be this one *
that is still a pretty accurate description .
the patients told me the fakers didn't know the side effects of medications or how it really felt to be manic or hallucinating . there some amusing situations . in the living room talking to one of my regulars , she said she was hallucinating a marching band . during a quiet spot in the conversation , i heard it , too . there was a high school band playing at a nearby practice field . a faker wouldn't have assumed they were hallucinating .
yes that was exactly it . they were admitted after initially reporting they repeatedly heard the word " thump " . that was the only lie they were instructed to tell and after this they were told to act entirely sane . one of the participants remained institutionalised for <NUM> months . edit : adam curtis did a documentary on the topic . he discusses this study around about <NUM> minutes .
<TRNC> every time . there are no decent alternatives for people who are either allergic or have a history of addiction and who don't want to risk their sobriety . or imagine when there is a medication that works , but for whatever reason there is a severe shortage so the patients can't get it . this is what i am dealing with : both the allergy to opium based drugs and the drug shortage . yet , before i found out that opiates / opioids don't work for me , it took years before doctors took the pain seriously .
<TRNC> , and i'm tired of the constant dismissal . narcotic abuse is a problem . junkies are a real thing . but i was sent home from the er once in excruciating pain because the doctors assume i was a seeker . when they asked me my pain level from <NUM> to <NUM> , apparently i was screaming too much to answer with the right number . they kept me long enough to make sure my blood pressure came down from what would cause a stroke and signed me out . not everyone in pain is a drug addict .
<TRNC> done to investigate non-psychiatric symptoms . they may not jump to surgery if you say you swallowed metal but have a benign exam , normal vitals and no abnormalities on imaging . most of the criteria for psychiatric illnesses rely on patients ' report of symptoms and provider's assessment of their mental state . there are no blood tests or imaging studies that can confirm a diagnosis . but i agree , it's unsurprising that patients instructed to act as though they had a psychiatric illness were diagnosed with psychiatric illnesses based on current diagnostic criteria . edit : typo
not to undermine your point , but where are the headlines about the millions of doctors worldwide who just go about their day doing their best for people ? you have a very small sample size there .
that the word homophobia was originally used to refer to heterosexual men's fear that others might think they are gay
<TRNC> in a halfway house for people who had been committed with serious issues . they often tried to hide that they were hearing voices or seeing things from us in order to leave the restricted situation they lived in . they wanted to get out and go do what they wanted , so they'd hide things . it's not like a bodily illness where it's gone and they're " all better . " it's also cyclical - people's psychoses can wax and wane . mental health is a very complicated thing . edit : added a few words to expand
what if everyone turns on you and refuses to acknowledge this " study " ? frightening . edit : til to not trust anyone on reddit .
what study ?
i think the core of the issue was that they were not let to leave after showing that they no longer exhibited any symptoms ? this is the study on how individuals are categorised by confirming prior assumptions about them isn't it ?
if you think about it , it's clearly not that much of a scandal as at first glance . mental illnesses are mostly diagnosed on basis of conversations with the patients . hence someone who tells the doctor the right things will obviously get diagnosed . sure this has shown that people who are healthy can fake a mental illness , but i can't see that leading to a lot of problems . i mean , why would someone cheat themselves into a mental hospital ? i can't imagine it's very fun there .
a study sent <NUM> fake patients to psychiatric hospitals and all but <NUM> were diagnosed with schizophrenia . after publication , an offended hospital challenged the author to fool them . he agreed . hospital then diagnosed <NUM> % of incoming patients as fakes . in reality , he sent no patients at all .
heh , tell that to chronic pain patients . edit : so for clarification , i am not demonizing chronic pain patients . my point was that history and questioning are still very important even with internal medicine / surgery , and not everything can be seen on x-ray .
this needs to stay on the front page for a while .
in germany there is one guy who was accepted as a managing psychiatrist at a large psychiatric hospital . he even wrote expertises for court proceedings . he also said that no matter what you always get a diagnose at a psychiatric facility . if you deny the diagnosis , you're getting diagnosed with deniance <TRNC>

baloo from the jungle book is lazy because he's literally supposed to be a " sloth bear "
great point . physical conditions can be empirically verified through largely objective methods , whereas mental illness does rely on subjective descriptions of symptoms .
the word you're looking for is " drug seekers " / s seriously though , my friends mom has chronic pancreatitis . dilaudid is the bare minimum for managing the pain when it's acting up . however there are plenty of times where she'd show up to her hospital , telling them about the pain , and they're reluctant to even give her percocet . she had to go to a different hospital , near her daughter's house and they tried to give her motrin . as if that would do anything .

smart move . trying to cram lotr into a single <NUM>hr film is utter nonsense . as it was they had to cut tom bombadil .
they got a little carried away with the hobbit , though ...
<TRNC> there's a pretty detailed fan theory that's been posted multiple times in this thread that points out how tom bombabil could be a huge evil presence . with the balrog , shelob , the watcher in the water and various other beings as evidence that ancient evils still exist , i don't think it's that it's too much of a stretch that some rando in the middle of a sketchy ass forest who acts like an aloof niceguy that just * happens * to know way too much about the creation of the world could be an evil guy .

its always crazy to learn about the nazi connection with companies that still exist today like , volkswagen , hugo boss , and fanta
can't speak for the one / u / hanassholosolo posted , but this is the one i've seen and it uses the extended cuts :
lotr with modern cgi capabilities would've been . . . even more awesome . they could've done that with the hobbit , possibly . remember , return of the king was made <NUM><NUM> years ago by now . that's over a decade of improvements in processing power and capabilities .
i remember trying to recreate it in age of empires ' map editor . good times .
i feel like i'm the only one who hates that character . i'm glad he got cut i don't want to watch that dude frolic around everywhere and listen to his shitty word poetry . dude was annoying . i always skip his chapters in rereads .
that's the problem : they probably wouldn't have stayed true to the lotr method . they would have used waaay more cgi and less practical effects to save money and because they'd be filming in <NUM>d . i think we're incredibly lucky the lotr films were made when they were , when cgi was decent but not so cheap you could use it everywhere , and before <NUM>d became a thing .
is <NUM>d even that popular anymore ? among viewers , i mean ? i always assumed it was just a fad for a few years after " avatar " popularised it , and that nobody had too much interest in it anymore
and yet he still managed to cut out some of the best stuff from the books . specifically , the scouring of the shire . death by impalement by saruman was incredibly lame and anticlimactic .
<TRNC> pretty good . had too much camp and comic relief . the battle was ok . not great , not terrible . just ok . giving the bear guy like <NUM> seconds of screentime was a mistake . he should have had a whole minute or <NUM> of action . cgi dwarf guy was odd but acceptable , but the lack of any sort of tactics in movie battles bothers me . plus how did all those armored trolls die right before they crash the gate ? what shot them ? nobody knows . they just sorta fall over .
excellent analysis . i'm stealing several of these points the next time this movie is discussed amongst friends .
maybe i just don't know what i'm talking about , but i can't imagine the type of marijuana available back then eliciting such a response . maybe someone with more experience than me can confirm / deny that marijuana affects people differently , similar to alcohol ?

jesus , can you show us on the doll where the hobbit touched you ? while they have problems and certainly are not totally faithful adaptations of the book , they are far from " wretched " with " nothing good in any of them " hell , freeman and mckellan's performances alone elevate them above a lot of films .

<TRNC> these movies on time and really only peter could have . the behind the scenes makes him look so unenthusiastic in the process . the hobbit should have been a one-off , incredible <NUM>½ - <NUM> hour movie , or a really solid set of two <NUM> hour movies . the trilogy doesn't work at all ; hell the <NUM>rd movie is barely even a movie . i'm going to check out the <NUM> hour cut because despite the excellent criticisms above , it can't be worse than <NUM>½ hours over three movies with so much useless shit happening .
here in korea they are showing the extended versions of each film in theaters , one a week . i missed seeing them in theaters back in the early <NUM>s so it has been great . the four hours actually flew by for the fellowship , tonight at midnight i'm seeing two towers . this post just blew my mind . i can't even fathom it not being a trilogy . good on you pete !
thankfully , someone took the trilogy and cut it into a <NUM> - hour movie .
<TRNC> , $ <NUM>m for <NUM> movies was way too much . weinstein called him a fool and that the project was one of the biggest sure things he'd seen in years . nevertheless , he tried to reach a consensus by suggesting one film . neither jackson nor eisner liked it so weinstein sold the rights to free up jackson to make the movie the way he wanted . that was the beginning of the end of harvey and eisner's relationship , and would be the first nail in eisner's figurative coffin as he was ousted <NUM> years later .
that due to budget issues , the lord of the rings trilogy was briefly planned as one film . helm's deep and saruman were cut , rohan and gondor merged with éowyn as boromir's sister , etc . upset by the idea of " cutting out half the good stuff , " peter jackson left miramax and went to new line cinema .
[ removed ]
<TRNC> awesome battles against a demon king and winning a princess's hand . " i mean which of these is the easier movie pitch ? it's not really a contest , huh ? if the entire fellowship had gone to mordor together , i think poor sam might not have even made it into the script . but tolkien gave pj no choice . it was all because tolkien divided the story threads that peter even gave the hobbits a fighting chance . in the new movies everyone's in the same group so peter naturally gravitates towards the aragorniest character .

<TRNC> have to ! _ and suddenly out of nowhere this totally irrelevant character trundles along on an adventure he has shown no interest in participating in . it was so crap to me that pretty much knew the film was going to be terrible from there on out . it made no sense either because they didn't really cut anything and spent a long time on that sequence so to not adapt it accurately , and in a necessary manner to give bilbo a bloody character , seemed bizarre . other than that i completely agree with your analysis .
this is a beautiful explanation about how wretched the hobbit movies were . the lotr movies came out when i was in high school and i had read tolkein many times . i saw each of them in the theaters at least five times and then again many times later , but the hobbits i've seen one time each . there is nothing good in any of them , hardly even a good scene .
i wonder if nasa has procedures in place for the unlikely event of a stowaway on a space station

gobert is in consideration for dpoy . you can't say its becoming more debatable .
the stats show he's better than gobert on d tho ...
this is it . this is the article that turns r / nba against us and the process .
yet the sixers have continued on winning despite his absence .
or he needs a relevant creator like simmons on the floor next to him
two french twins became scientific celebrities after publishing a revolutionary theory about the first moments of the big bang in several reputable scientific journals , it was later discovered that despite passing peer review , the papers were complete gibberish

i'm so confused if the statistics show that embiid is better defensively than everyone and he's just barely worse than cousins offensively how tf is rudy gobert better ? only thing you can point to is a minutes restriction ? 😂 😂 😂 foh . he's better .
* because embiid is bastard man ! ! *
i've always wondered how they did that
do you mean anti-anti-adblock ?
<TRNC> be embarrassed but sadly i ’ m not sure one can single out trend as being particularly poor at their testing , ” woodward said . > > > “ i think what it demonstrates is just how complex these system have become and as we all know complexity is the enemy of security . ” > > > in recent months , google ’ s tavis ormandy has been hunting bugs in anti-virus product , in the belief that sometimes security tools make companies more vulnerable , not less . his recent scalps have included kaspersky and symantec .
ok , so trend micro is terrible . for the sake of discussion , what is everyone else here using / suggest ? specifically for ~ <NUM> endpoints .
west essentially killed his mother . i hate that guy and his pathetic terrible small dicked loser fans but jesus that is a horrible thing to have to live through . wealth , fame , success and ultimately all of it killed your own mom . i mean , his music is god awful , he lacks any talent at all , and only people with terrible taste like his output but can you imagine ? he didn't deserve to get wealthy enough to cause this tragedy but here we are .
yes . you can be a nice and decent guy in some areas of your life , and a scumbag in others .

yes , that's the main reason , kanye specifically wanted to give his mom the things she couldn't afford . house , cars , surgery , etc . was all because he just genuinely wanted to give her anything she could want . really tragic when you look at it from that perspective

yah if you cant stop to poop in a toilet wearing diapers makes a lot of sense . you can just poop right in them and change later . diapers are really great . i have crohn's disease and sometimes if i have a long drive ill wear diapers , just in fucking case , though ive never shit in them , i did leak some blood once though .
definitely marked the downturn of hip-hop , you are correct . that album was the low point in the kanye catalogue for me .
you'd think this would be common sense . i don't get it . we pre-screen pets to make sure everything is routine for elective spays / neuters . why wouldn't doctors do the same thing for elective surgery ? ? ?
orange county is actually the big exception here . orange county is this tiny blotch of deep , deep red surrounded by an ocean of blue .
eh not really . he was just a moderate republican . you can't use alabama as your definition of republican
> having a phd doesn't necessitate intelligence . yes it does . but being intelligent is not the same thing as being rational , and barely even correlates . we all know a clever dipshit .
don't know much about it and wikipedia article didn't really answer my question , but why would he feel responsible ? is it because his wealth is the only reason she could afford surgery ?
having a phd doesn't necessitate intelligence . it was in english education , anyway . i mean we have the astronaut who drove miles in diapers to murder someone cross-country due to an obsession .
so even his mom wanted nothing to do with him ?
you're talking about the same guy that had a decades-long affair and a hush-hush baby with his maid , right ?
pfft we all know she killed herself cause kanye is such a disappointment
<TRNC> the closest thing we have to fact is “ common opinion ” . everything is an opinion . the way you dress is an expression of your opinion . your religious beliefs are your opinion . the music you turn up loud is your opinion . for most people it ’ s easier to just agree . for me the hardest thing is to ‘ just ’ agree and that is what sparks creativity , the feeling that something can be better , the feeling that something ’ s missing . the feeling that something ’ s needed . "
the law itself sets a very low proof standard though . i live in ca and was permitted to see any general practitioner of my choosing for a physical , and she was not required to have access to my prior medical history in order to sign off . this law wouldn't have saved donda west , who doctor-shopped her way to an early death . she was rejected by physician number <NUM> after revealing her heart disease history then intentionally hid this info from her subsequent doctor .
> kanye's other music [ " hey mama " ] deserves a special mention
if my spokes are messed up , is there anything i can do with modest tools to fix it ?
sad , but still , fuck kanye . my dad died at the worst possible moment , would that justify my being a complete ass hat ? no . fuck this dude and everything he stands for .
<TRNC> or kill them . she had a phd , she understood why the doctors objected to her getting the surgery , and she understood that by lying to the next doctor she was taking a risk . she made the calculated decision to ignore that risk . she then doubled and tripled down on ignoring medical advice by first ignoring the recommendation to stay at a facility where she would be monitored and then by having a relative look after them . this comes down to a lot of hubris and thinking that you know better than other people .
i feel so bad for kanye . i know reddit is pretty divided over him , but i know a large part of him feels pretty responsible for his mother's death , and that would take a mental toll on anyone .
he was a surprisingly good politician .
this doesn't sound like someone who would've birthed kanye at all . / s
that after kanye west's mother's death due to heart problems resulting from her cosmetic surgery , governor schwarzenegger signed the " donda west law " legislation making it mandatory to prove well being prior to undergoing cosmetic surgery .
anybody else feel like this article really isn't very good ? i like the title , obviously , but he says a lot of things that make me think that he hasn't actually watched any sixer basketball . he just regurgitates a bunch of stats that we've all seen before and doesn't tie it to any observations or subjective thought . might just be the fact that i've slept a total of <NUM> hours in <NUM> days though .
a californian republican is a democrat in most other states .
unfortunately like ted cruz , he was not born in america .

as a republican , he implemented cap and trade to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a response to climate change .
<TRNC> entered office to a sex scandal on his way out of office . there's a neat symmetry to it all , especially when you consider that while he was governor , all of california got screwed . > the man who was against borrowing broke borrowing records . > the man who said he didn't need to raise campaign donations raised more than anyone . > the man who replaced a governor with a <NUM> % popularity rating ended up matching that all-time low . > the man who promised to balance the budget left office with record deficits .
<TRNC> me if you wanted to . mansa musa was the richest man to ever live and could afford for them to all carry a shit ton of gold . he dressed them well and fed them well because he was a devout muslim and it made him look good to have his slaves look better than the common folk of other countries . essentially he was stunting on everyone and it cost him in the end because it just let the entire known world that there exist a country with a shit ton of gold and an inferior military .

but the only reason you have this prejudice against them is based on this tribunal . if the tribunal was based on lies then you have been manipulated . since you know about it and choose to remain ignorant you become a bigot .
<TRNC> when he was the highest paid player . they played in <NUM> super bowls after his big contracts . but nope , his contract is the mvp . edit : to add on to this , his contract he signed meant that if he got cut in <NUM> , he'd have $ <NUM>m in dead money . if he gets cut next year , it's still $ <NUM>m . that means that if he sucked they are hurting bad with money . the team gambled on a <NUM> year old quarterback staying healthy and not falling off a cliff .

to be fair , brady hasn't been a first team all pro player since <NUM> . he's a still a quality quarterback and his contract is a great deal , but let's not pretend he's been a first team all pro recently .
the director of star wars : the last jedi also wrote the critically acclaimed " ozymandias " episode of breaking bad .
there should definitely be some investigations to see whether or not brady is going to get paid under the table after he retires or in some other way . its pretty ridiculous to think he's been taking pay cuts his entire career to this magnitude .
he could've gotten more than being * the highest paid player in the league ? * that deal wasn't paying him enough ?

all you fans of jc's " the thing " should check out the original <NUM> version , " the thing from another world , " generally credited to howard hawks as director , although he is officially listed as producer . though the alien here is no match for the murderous morphing madness of his successor , the dialogue and the tension are top notch . in glorious black & white !
i love that film . it's just perfect ... im not superstitious . but whenever i hear that fucking soundtrack i get ready to fight . i don't know what it is ... i think that says a lot about the movie . it's absolutely in my top <NUM>
* the thing * is still my favorite horror movie ever . plus * they live * was pure fun . and * dark star * was rough but very twisted .

the concept of having only two strict genders is historically fairly recent , and there are countless societies around the world who had a non-binary gender system for thousands of years before encountering european societies for the first time
that movie is in my top <NUM> , right after aliens and terminator <NUM> .
i prefer their actual player , or at least the ui with their x-ray stuff . but yeah the main layout is worse .
they should join forces , let netflix handle all their digital entertainment and amazon stick to the shopping side . not that amazon is bad at it but less splintered would probably save a lot of headaches . maybe just add another $ <NUM> to a prime membership for netflix but still allow netflix to be separate
<TRNC> probably have enough data to figure out what can lead to more people subscribing . they have a lot of subscribers but they have an enormous amount of room to grow so they're focusing on increasing value as efficiently as possible . they track everything you do on the site so they know what shows and movies get watched for how long , as well as what people who have free trials search for and then don't subscribe so they know what's missing . that's why they hire good data analysts , to figure out those trends and patterns .
<TRNC> film had already racked up <NUM> million views in the first <NUM> days after its release in north america . can someone explain this to me ? not just this situation , but movies and tv shows on netflix in general . if they purchase the rights to something for , let's say , $ <NUM> million , and only stream it , how do they expect to make that money back ? entice potential customers to try out the services and eventually subscribe ? keep current customers happy by not unsubscribing ? very fascinated by the streaming model .
not sure why you are down voted , you described the future of media consumption .
it's interesting to me how amazon has struggled a lot more than netflix in producing high quality first party films / shows . i mean the production quality is just so much lower for a lot of amazon's stuff imho . not that it's all bad , just a bunch always feels less professional . like how netflix got house of cards , when amazon made alpha house .
hello friend could you tell netflix to add back suite life of zack and cody / on deck and wizards of waverly place thank you lad
what about rotten tomatoes ?
> in particular , the common orange and the grapefruit are assumed to be natural occurring hybrids between the pomelo and the mandarin , with the pomelo providing the bigger size and greater firmness . til that natural hybrids are a thing .
<TRNC> because you can't describe them without using the two main genders . if you want to call them sub-genders by all means go ahead , but they are not genders . also - isn't this the opposite direction than where progressives were trying to head ? didn't we used to want to fight that females can be into stereotypical male activities and interests and it would be okay ? now we're implying every slight difference needs its own gender category ? just comes off as backwards to me , or like some people grasping desperately at excuses for victimhood .
netflix runs on amazon's services to run their servers anyways . edit : i know everybody uses aws . just pointing it out for people who don't know .
there are only four original citrus species . all others are hybrids .
> or the number of species of dogs . hundreds of breeds , one species .
like how [ wild cabbage ] lead to cabbage , cauliflower , broccoli , kale , brussels sprouts . or the number of species of dogs . selective breeding is crazy .
seriously , cable companies should be shitting their pants . i convinced my parents to cancel their cable package .
pomelo is my favorite citrus snack . it takes a bit to get into but once you are at the edible parts it cant be beat . the cells are large and separated making them great for slow snacking and they are just the right amount of sweet and sour .
netflix and amazon are spending more money and buying more films than any other studio at sundance this year
imdb is owned by amazon .
that's messed up
look up apples and how they propagate . the way i understand it is that its very hard to produce " pure-breed " apples because of how easily they hybridize and share traits amongst nearby trees .
if you watch prime videos on the amazon app , you can view imdb actor info in realtime by tapping the screen . it's actually pretty cool , as it tracks the actors currently in each scene .
i love all of that about netflix . i really do . but it also makes me feel like the presented viewing options are kind of a bubble they're creating around me and that annoys me . it's nice that they can learn that sci-fi and horror are my genres-of-choosing but so far they've failed to figure out that sometimes i just want to cry myself to sleep to an idiotic romcom without interjecting that shit into my normal listings .
maybe autoplay is the wrong word ? you see when i start up the app on my ps<NUM> . when you hover over a video a little preview starts to play in the background which quickly becomes annoying
oh my god
i tend to agree . amazon clearly has some savvy in the industry , but has a terrible interface compared to netflix .
especially because often times multiple people watch on one profile . i have a huge variety of shows on my account , the rankings are usually way off . they should just sign a deal with imdb . if they had the imdb score by every movie and show that would make finding shows so much easier .
my internet provider called me to offer my faster internet at a lower price . and then managed to convince me to get their lowest tier tv package , and threw in the sports channels for free . so my bill went up $ <NUM> a month from $ <NUM> - $ <NUM> and i have much faster internet and i also have cable tv and all the sports i want to watch . sports was the only reason i ever wanted cable ... it was a no brainer . thanks streaming companies !
huh , never would've expected that
weird . citron is the swedish word for lemon .
i personally use imdb because it's a guage of what the typical audience thinks , which critics tend to over exaggerate their thoughts and ideals . read some of the critics reviews about project x some literally say it's abhorrent and the worst movie ever made haha .
to be fair , i'd much rather pay $ <NUM> a month and be able to cancel if i want to , than pay $ <NUM> for a year with prime and be locked into it .
it's hilarious to me that a ton of people are replying to this comment asking the guy to make serious changes to netflix , like he has any say whatsoever .
they say the recipe for sprite is lemon and lime . i tried making it at home , there is more to it then that !
one of the characters in brave new world died while high on soma , the hallucinogenic drug of choice . i think the idea had been in his mind for years before .

<TRNC> you live in australia , the artwork for house of cards is different if you lived in ny . if you typically watch a lot of " action " type movies , the artwork / title logo on thumbnails for shows / films will use the delegated " action " looking visuals even if the show isn't really an " action " show . the entire presentation of box art on your netflix ui is slowly being created to appeal to your watching trends in more ways that you think . source : i work in their marketing department .
that was almost <NUM> f'ing years ago .
just wanted to point out that you're using mb / s while the post you replied to is using mb / s . mb is <NUM> times more data than mb . he probably went from <NUM>mbit / s to <NUM>mbit / s . this doesn't negate your point in any way , but it makes the difference you highlighted a bit less dramatic . edit : " point out " instead if " point put "
tell them to put back the actual review scores and not expected ratings . they are trash .
other places of note : great and little snoring condom edit - some cracking place names in the us though i believe ! us redditors ?
you can have netflix , amazon and hulu all ad free versions for less than comcasts basic cable . guess that explains why they have enough cash laying around to buy things like nbc .
seeing this thread made me google it and i'm up to chapter six in the last fifty minutes . i've just had a big argument with my daughter about whether its a dystopia or not .
the people of shitterton , uk , banded together to buy a big rock to put the name on . as people kept stealing the sign .
this is exactly how i want to go if i actually die on a bed .
i dunno man ... have you ever had a trip turn south and get scary because of something really simple like someone looking at you wrong or the sky getting cloudy ? imagine how scary it might be if you're in pain and literally facing death ? just my thought though . maybe if you had the right mindset going in <TRNC>
i am honestly curious : if you realize that cows , pigs , chicken and fish all have their own realities , do you still support the systematic torture of animals that animal agriculture brings ? do you still eat their corpses in the way you might refuse to eat your dog or your friend's cat or even a random horse , thinking it grosses you out a little ?
<TRNC> for me , it has a strong anesthetic and dissociative effect : i felt like i went through death . all the way through . now i don't think about death , don't worry about it , don't fear it . at least i don't consciously . it feels like it's in the past for me , in a very palpable way . if psychedelics can help us change the way our brain works , even if it's just a trick of chemistry , it can't be any worse than messing with our serotonin levels mechanically , via ssris .
<TRNC> as a filmmaker who has gottem offers from both companies i have to say that amazon is far more generous with how they pay indie filmmakers and if you want to support an indie movie , you should watch it on prime . amazon pays more and pays by minutes watched which ends up being far more than netflix's lump sum . i also respecr and love amazon doing what i originally thought netflix would do , letting anyone submit a film directly to prime . i think that is a huge door opener to avoid crummy distribution companies .
you should read " we " by yevgeny zamyatin , it was the influence for both those books but written in <NUM> .

neither of them discovered the double helix , it was rosalind franklin .
yes . please . i put off reading it for the longest time but it really was such a great read . it's like an alternate take on george orwell's <NUM> ; which is funny to say considering huxley was his teacher .
<TRNC> is not just me , i have a friend who had been taking anti-depressant pills for over <NUM> years after she lost her father . she took mushrooms with me for the first time and stopped taking anti-depressant pills the next day . it's been <NUM> years for her now and she hasn't gone back to pills yet . anecdotal evidence is not sufficient evidence , sure , but what else can we have when scientific research has been * mostly * banned on this subject ? and any recent research that has been done has only confirmed this .
<TRNC> . doors of perception does a great job explaining step-by-step why the experience cannot be dismissed as " you were tripping " , because from a philosophical point of view it is a more fundamentally accurate view of reality than the non-tripping viewpoint - - we become more rational , not less . this is why we need these chemicals to become accessible to more people - - writers , scientists , medical researchers , politicians . it takes a writer like huxley to get down what all of the hippies are trying , and failing , to say .
we tried to cancel comcast and have internet only and they lowered our price and gave us all the movie channels for free just to stay . now the box lets us stream netflix . i just prefer netflix over anything else .
it sound amazing .
my grandmother died tripping fell right down the stairs
he also wrote _doors of perception _ about his experiences with mescaline . jim morrison read it and was inspired to name his band after the title .
super good investment considering the website ip is <NUM> years old . imdb is a real og as far as websites are concerned .
it's from a guy that drank way too much whiskey . his name was t_wrx <NUM> . you've probably never heard of him .
aldous huxley , author of brave new world , took lsd on his deathbed and died tripping .
same day as jfk and cs lewis .
<TRNC> that when you take them you can observe certain facts about the nature of the mind and the universe empirically . i think he even commented something along the lines that he felt like a * philosophical journalist * - meaning he was empirically observing certain facts firsthand . so it isn't so much that hallucinogens make you more rational , and you have a heightened ability to use logic to figure things out , it is that psychedelics remove blinders from your mind allowing you to * observe * facets of experience that you aren't normally aware of .
huxley wrote brave new world before trying hallucinogenics , and i'm pretty sure he had a negative image of drug use prior to his trying mescaline . after the doors of perception he wrote the island , brave new world's sequel . on the titular island people used hallucinogenics in a more positive way than soma was depicted .
honestly that's a very small dose . if i was dying i'd be dropping a milligram
that also happens in fucking , austria . fucking tourists keep pinching the fucking sign .
when i take acid , there's a point in which i can see the world as if there were <NUM>d grid lines showing the relationship between everything like my hand , the ground , the stars , etc . makes sense why ancient civilizations loved tripping and doing math n science .

<TRNC> nope . after adjusting for revenue the tarp program generated a net * gain * of around <NUM> billion . that's right . you won't hear people on reddit acknowledge this much so try to remember . the infamous bailout was a profit generating program . edit : since people are asking for a source this is right off wikipedia . you can google it but here's a link if you'd like relevant info at the bottom of the introductory section . and since i know people may knock me for citing wikipedia , here is the underlying source :

it was probably the most realistic way of getting people to accept the plan . they potentially avoided a war , so even though it was expensive , it was probably a very smart move .

the civil war was fundamentally over slavery . any other reasons they'll provide will link back to it . every seceding state listed slavery as a primary reason . the civil war was a war kicked off by tensions over slavery . anyone who says otherwise is trying to revise history .
lords aren't people ?
the money went to the slave owners , not the slaves , so think of how rich the south would be if the union paid the slave owners ? the other aspect of it is they sent most of them back to africa . that's why there isn't as strong a black population in england as the us and they've been sending them back for centuries . queen elizabeth did it at the end of the <NUM>th century .

<NUM> billion ? so like one unnecessary war ?
<NUM> % may not seem like a lot , but it is an enormous expense for any nation . for comparison this would be like the us floating a project that would cost the state <NUM> billion dollars . to give you an idea of the scale this would be the cost to manufacture <NUM> top of the line modern aircraft carriers
when britain abolished slavery they simply bought up all the slaves and freed them . it cost a third of the entire national budget , around £ <NUM> billion in today's money .

<NUM> % is not one third ... edit : there is nothing in the link about budget lol
can i come live with you ? i don't want to be in the us anymore
uh , guys ... we're not saints . britain has done some disgustingly horrendous things in the name of self interest .
yeah but it kind of means you bought slaves . really the slave owners should have been told tough cookies you can't own people .
or , to put it another way , all british adults * have paid for slaves .
who had considerable power and who formed , more or less , the oligarchy . a lot of folk in the confederacy owned only one slave . most owned none . and a few in power held the majority . however , you emancipate the slaves , leave the big boys without their workforce and zer <NUM> compensation and you get a war on your hands . the brits definitely made the wiser move and as a result paid , by far , the cheaper price .
not " people " , just a couple hundred lords .
if the us did something similar to this do you think things would have been different with race relations and the whole war thing ? would it have been possible for the us to have done something like that ?
from / u / aenor : > britain borrowed to pay off the slave owners - and finally paid the debt for it in <NUM> . which means that living brits helped pay for the ending of the slave trade with their taxes .

they were in a prison camp in an enemy country surrounded by american soldiers with guns . i think in that situation you do whatever you can to distance yourself from war crimes regardless of how much you might have supported the thing in the past when you were free and had the full support of your own government .
<TRNC> , such as psilocybin mushrooms , ayahuasca , peyote , etc . i recommend consuming these substances with a person or group that you are very comfortable with , preferably with at least <NUM> person who is completely sober as a " trip-sitter . " make sure your environment is comfortable . wait for a nice , sunny day and go to a secluded beach . bring fruits and water and have a relaxing picnic . disclaimer : only take substances that are legal in your country . i do not advocate breaking laws . have a safe trip !

german soldiers in american pow camps dramatically burned their german uniforms after being shown films of the atrocities of the holocaust .
<TRNC> does all his shit alone . no stupid team to help him . just a man with a huge amount of gadgets against the world . no stupid dialogues or relationships , just sneaking . doesn't even have to kill anybody ... but i guess we will see some form of specialist team , with a hacker girl , a black weapons guy , and a female latino officer who is the connection between sams team and some us general / president . then its some terrorist with a dirty bomb and some evil company who helps those terrorists .
i always show [ this image of german pows reacting to footage of concentration camps . ] i often see people refer to german infantry from wwii in such despicable , dehumanizing ways . they incorrectly believe that the common german soldier and sometimes citizen fully understood and condoned the holocaust . that simply is not true . they were merely people fighting for their country and people . for anyone wanting more info on this photograph , [ here is an article about it . ]

<TRNC> backstory . that allowed us to make up our own world and really augment and fill out the characters . i don ’ t think one applies to the other because i don ’ t think our movie will feel like a movie that came out of a video game , i think it ’ ll feel like a badass , tom hardy action movie , which is what we wanted . let that sink in for a minute . i don't get it . how could a guy so invested in a project know so little about it ?
please , for the love of god don't setup an extended universe of some kind , pander to both the movie and the video game audience in a way that ruins the film because of it--just make a film that happened to be a video game , and don't even think about setting up a sequel . edit : " be " instead of " by " and " kind " instead of " sought " .
that during wwii , king christian x of denmark was one of the only rulers of an occupied country who refused to go into exile for his own safety . he took daily rides through copenhagen unattended to show he was not afraid .
<TRNC> stand out precisely because they are simple characters with very little backstory . this movie should have like <NUM> lines of dialogue , tops , a really simple and even cliche / timeless plot , and just long dark scenes with no dialogue and great music to make up the movie . also , i really hope the soundtrack is good . amon tobin's ost for chaos theory was ridiculous and really set the mood for the game . unfortunately , i fear this movie will go the way of assasins creed , and essentially ignore all of these things
sam has a team in every game except for like , conviction , and that's one of the less liked games of the franchise
muh r-rated game kino though ! ! !
in flash it works fairly well you want a real example look at arrow , it's so packed with characters that they have no idea how to use anyone now .
