capitalism causes competition that alienates even family members from each other , there is no child-bearing because that would decrease the competitive edge of the parents , while the new child would decrease the profit of the family members , while also it would mean that the parents would need to create a new competition , therefore it becomes irrational to give birth to new children , resulting in an extremely declining birthrate , consequently leading to the complete collapse of capitalist societies after a few centuries and their conquest by collectivist , religious fundamentalist and environmentalist societies .

why do people think it is more compassionate to keep a dog in a cage for years on end ?
how does that work ? wouldnt they at some point be overrun ?
the other option is like ... forced sterilization of dogs . maybe there should be a " dog breeding tax " and you pay a fee for every dog you own that isn't spayed / neutered and the money gets sent straight to shelters .
so killing animals for meat is illegal too ?
dogs are not allowed to drive in germany .
germany constitutionally protects the life of a dog and cat but not a baby ... makes perfect sense . no hypocrisy there ...
i'm german too , i live in the states now i feel like a total moron for not knowing whats they do to the poor doogos here .
how would german law handle people who go to animal shelters to get puppies and kittens to feed to their pet snakes ? i didn't know this was a thing until recently , but i'm not sure it's punished in the us , so i'd like to think it might be in germany .
i also volunteer at a kill shelter . no-kill shelters are nice idea but not practical when there are finite resources .

germany probably has fewer dogs
> window shopping dogs isn't a thing in germany , i have never seen a dog in a window like you sometimes see in american films . to be fair , i don't think that happens in the us either . at least i'm american and have never seen it . . but we * do * have a big problem with puppy farms and uncontrolled mating . which is much worse than the picture perfect window shopping you see in films .
sounds hypocritical .
they also refuse to take in dogs that will be difficult to adopt out . no kill shelters are bullshit , they just push the dirty work onto others .
people love the sound of a no-kill shelter . have you ever been to one ? have you ever seen the dogs that have serious mental and behavioral problems that have been there for years . no sane person would ever adopt them , so they sit in a cage , rotting away , slipping further and further into manic behavior . no-kill shelters aren't daisy's and rainbows - atleast when a dog is put down it is sedated first with ketamine . i'd take that over losing my absolute mind in a cage for <NUM> years .
> they are either killed , or it literally looks like a concentration camp . what do you think happens at concentration camps ?
i volunteered at a kill shelter in my state . no-kill shelters do not exist in the us without kill shelters because they will send their animals to kill-shelters so that they can be " no-kill . " the shelter i worked at did their best to get animals adopted before having to resort to euthanasia . most of our adoption events drummed up a lot of support , so they didn't have to put animals down too often . edit : looks like this goes both ways ! no-kill shelters will also take animals from kill-shelters too .
germany evidently disagrees .
that is clearly discrimination ... how can they justify this ?
how does that work ? does germany just have a lot more shelters than the us ? or are they larger / better funded ? or are there a lot fewer stray dogs ? or are your shelters just highly overcrowded ? edit : aight so the consensus seems to be that germany has not so many doggos while the american woofer count is through the roof
killing them for food shouldn't be a proper reason , since it's completely unnecessary .
do you know why that is ? i know here they put some effort in campaigning against getting a pet as a christmas / birthday present unless you are super comitted . these psas are mostly made before holidays . naturally they still have the heaviest load <NUM><NUM> weeks after christmas / easter but maybe that helps quite a bit already .
i work at a kill animal shelter in australia , the no-kill shelters just transfer their dogs to here when they need to be euthanized ... so they still can ' technically ' be no kill . but we have a rigorous decision process anyway before it happens and the main reasons are if they have health issues or behavioural issues that can't be solved .
so shoes and bacon , those are still good reasons right ?
it's a bit like being a nurse or a doctor . you may not be able to save them all but the ones you do make up for it .
so it's better to just kill them ? i don't know man , sounds wrong .
this guy was also a separatist . that's treason and it's wrong so i'm glad this disgusting traitor to the us is rotting in the ground .

concentration camps and death camps weren't always the same . some camps were for holding political prisoners , jews , roma , and other groups , some for pows , and some for forced labor . at the labor concentration camps you could be worked to death , and many were , but the fully dedicated death factory concentration camps weren't as common , albeit they were more effective at killing people .
well you know what they say about coal tar !
are you saying the only reason no-kill shelters exist is because they simply ship their dogs over to other shelters to be killed , thereby absolving themselves of responsibility ? because that sounds like a load of shit .
> usually dogs with physically desirable traits like pointed ears and good muscle tone get scooped up by no-kill shelters so they can charge <NUM>x the adoption fee . ugh , really ? the people who do that are fucking shitty .
well germany has <NUM> million dogs and the us has <NUM> million dogs . divided on population germany has <NUM> people for every dog and the us has <NUM> people for every dog . if the us had <NUM>/<NUM> th of the current dog population no kill shelters would probably be much more common .
am i the only one who hates the word ' doggo ' ? up there with ' wifey ' .
compared to many other countries there are far less stray animals in germany .
same thing in the us . no kill shelters can either transfer animals out or make up a " valid " reason to put the animal down that still keeps their no kill status . no kill is just a scam to grab donations and it unfairly makes traditional shelters look like the bad guys .
i live in maine , we do not have " kill shelters " it is largely based on spaying and neutering education and a general love and appreciation for animals . our shelters spend money importing dogs from southern states . people will then line up to spend anywhere from $ <NUM> - $ <NUM> to adopt the dogs . source : i live here with my three shelter dogs
i am german . til that there are kill shelters .
<TRNC> have never seen a dog in a window like you sometimes see in american films . * buying a dog can be expensive , pure breeds often start at a few hundred € and can easily reach <NUM> € plus . * you are required to mark your dogs , either with dog tags or more commonly now with rfid chips . * even adopting a dog from a shelter will normally cost you money , they don't give them to you for free * to be a breeder you need to be certificated and member of a breeder association
no , he means if you want to drive in germany , you can't have a dog . classic oxford comma moment . * " dogs are not allowed , to drive in germany . " * edit : i know what an oxford comma is . apparently im just bad at setting strangers on the internet up for jokes . lmao .

then whats the point of the hundeführerschein ?

since many people around here assume that all the animal shelters are small and underfunded : this here is an aerial view of the newly build , <NUM> acre [ animal ] [ shelter ] in berlin : this is not even the biggest animal shelter in the eu .
no one wants mutts in america .
half of the attendees were pallbearers
bc they are underfunded . they are either killed , or it literally looks like a concentration camp . if they got funding , then they could be no-kill shelters . which the us does have no-kill shelters .
i too am a dentist and have only had to euthanize two patients . i feel like i'm doing pretty well for only three months on the job .
<TRNC> anyone even thinks about challenging that , the evidence to that is the millions of people around the world who are alive with no trace of animal inside them , so fuck off . edit : if you think cows should be slaughtered and dogs should sleep in your bed purely because you see one more than the other and one has nice cute fur and a name , then you should be pretty embarrassed at your lack of logic and cognitive reason . honestly how can you be satisfied with realizing your morals are so flimsy and undeveloped ?

i used to work at a shelter up north , we had a " rescue wagon " which would bring puppies from the south up to the north in order to be adopted . our shelter had so few strays that we imported them !

i don't know anything about this particular story , but if you throw raw eggs at someone , and hit them , getting punched is an outcome of which you should consider the possibility . edit : a hard-boiled egg is simple assault . a man wouldn't care . a raw egg is disrespect . be prepared for consequences .
sure they do ! but they want the mutts that you go to the pet stores and pay $ <NUM> + for instead of going to the local shelters and adopting for a fraction of the cost . it amazes me that people will run to furry babies or petland to finance a dog at <NUM> % rather than go to a shelter to get a dog for $ <NUM> or less . makes no sense to me but it makes sense why the shelters are filling up and dogs are dying .
even our french neighbours have kill shelters , sadly . in the southern parts of germany , there is an active community that rescues animals from french shelters and is trying to find new homes for them . i got both of my cats that way !
why no love for the invertebrates ? we need to save the bees !
when asked why he'd punched the man who'd hit him with a raw egg , uk politician john prescott said that he was following tony blair's orders to , " connect with the electorate . "

this amuses me . if people are languishing around homeless and unwanted should we just start putting them down too ? not advocating that we don't put down animals , we'd be overrun if we didn't . but i do love how people try to comfort themselves saying it's better for the animal and its what they would want . if you had the choice between death and a life of vagrancy which would you choose ?

that's awesome ! i wish the u . s . constitution said that . instead we get dumping coal tar in rivers is good for the steel magnates .
i'm being a devil's advocate here and trying to point out an issue in your logic . > it is literally dangerous to let large amounts of animals roam in the city , possibly not neutered . you can't compare this with homeless people . is a homeless man - - likely suffering from mental disorders - - safer than an uncastrated street dog ?
germany even mentions animal protection in their constitution . > mindful also of its responsibility toward future generations , the state shall protect the natural foundations of life and animals of the * grundgesetz * )

this is a vastly underrated comment . " no kill " doesn't allow for a release valve in places where there may be overpopulation . it also doesn't allow places to euthanize an animal that may be sick or a danger to those around them . this results in some of these dogs being abandoned and wandering the area . in this case , overpopulation simply continues outside of the shelter .
<TRNC> ' city . there was a no-kill shelter down the street . people went there with their pets and were turned away or encountered resistance because the shelter had no room . the terrified animal usually got abandoned in my neighborhood . i would have to take the animal down to the county shelter . it wasn't an evil den of death . the people at the county shelter were the nicest people you could deal with . i'm sure most of the animals did get put to sleep but it is better than languishing around frightened and unwanted .
that's what i was thinking right now . not sure if i have * ever * seen a stray dog in germany .
japanese here . our public shelter is kill shelter . <NUM> + % of dogs in shelter are end up killed by co<NUM> , around <NUM> dogs every fucking year . i am very ashamed of that . reform is unlikely due to political pressure from pet industory . i know germany is doing right . i always admire that .

on the other hand , a lot of no-kill shelters also take in dogs from kill shelters . it goes both ways . usually dogs with physically desirable traits like pointed ears and good muscle tone get scooped up by no-kill shelters so they can charge <NUM>x the adoption fee . it's a sucky system , but we gotta work with that we have . i got my pup from the pound the day before she got put down , don't regret it one bit .
the no kill shelters near me made a point of bringing dogs on the euthanizarion list in from high kill shelters and rehabbing dogs with behavioral problems , and placing them in homes suited to their personalities . it's not all scams . many of them go above and beyond and exist almost purely on donations .
seriously though , why the hell are some titles that long ? !
i've been living in munich for <NUM> years now and tbh i've never seen a stray dog . or at least i can't recall seeing one .
german agriculture also requires farmers to start harvesting a field in a very certain way . they must cut straight down the middle and move outwards , in order to scare the wildlife to the outskirts of the field . for contrast , na farmers start their fields by cutting the borders first . this allows for easier turning at the end of each row . this also causes wildlife to be herded to the center of the field , which is very unsafe for them .

<TRNC> even close to over it . never had a death impact me quite so profoundly . no-kill shelters do exist , even if all of them aren't really what they say they are . they're worth it , though . <NUM> dogs from this place and every single one of them were incredible . i think especially for dogs that have been without a home for so long , there's a profound level of emotion that comes with finally having one , and someone to be their comrade . then again , i've never known an ungrateful dog anyways .

yeah fuck edison , he stole a lot of teslas inventions
edison died rich as fuck , taking credit for other people's inventions , trying to monopolize filmmaking and electrocuting animals to demonize tesla's form of electricity .
if you know the history between the two it makes sense
also from the article : " radios used in the tank tended to interfere with the turret control system , resulting in uncontrolled turret movements whenever the radios were used at full power . " but wikipedia didn't answer the one question i wanted to know . when they fire the main gun , does it turn the heater on ? does anyone know ?

name one genius that ain't crazy .
<TRNC> a bit of a cult around him , and probably the best example is margret cheney's biography , * telsa : a man out of time * . it's an interesting read , but is * painfully * credulous . that's a book that seriously puts forward the idea that the tunguska event was precipitated by a test of tesla's wardenclyffe tower . the tl ;D r : any community of nerds ends up fawning over tesla , who's was as socially inept as they * actually * are , and as smart as they think themselves to be .
if tesla died first and this til was about a nasty obituary edison wrote for him , the contempt in this thread would be off the charts .
<TRNC> lab . tesla was a bright mind and very very proud and never understopd you first have to make it before you can claim the respect of your peers . both tesla and edison had rather odd behaviors and nowdadays one may speculate if they were autstic . in a historic sense edison fucking over poor tesla and everyone else doesn't hold much ground . at this point hating edison is just a huge circlejerk while forgetting how famous and important edison was . without him we wouldn't be sitting before modern computers now that much os for sure .
<TRNC> of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene ... his method was inefficient in the extreme , for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and , at first , i was almost a sorry witness of his doings , knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him <NUM> percent of the labor . but he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge , trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical american sense . "
<TRNC> stems back to a comic by the oatmeal , which used exteme hyperbole and ' humor ' to paint tesla as a figurative god of science and edison as evil incarnated as a soul sucking businessman . the comic was riddled with straight up misinformation ... but nonetheless people connected with the idea of an unsung hero and it sorta exploded . maybe i'm wrong but around the time that comic popped up is right around the time i remember starting to see other references and stuff painting the same black and white dichotomy between baby-jesus-tesla and judas / satan-edison
> " he had no hobby , cared for no sort of amusement of any kind ... " [ edison was a wizard on two wheels . ]
he fucked him over multiple times in multiple ways and tesla is not the only witness to it .. it's well documented and edison was known for doing shit like that . now . with that said tesla was by all means fucking nuts .. but crazy and genius go hand-in-hand .
that's a fantastic documentary . i learned so much watching it . for those that haven't seen it , it also covers , jp morgan , andrew carnegie , and vanderbilt . really really good !
why are we talking about oatmeal
i don't know a ton about either man but i know one murdered an elephant and the other didn't .
i mean think about it . has anyone ever seen them in the same room ?
edison believed obituaries should be positive . tesla believed that obituaries were better when they alternated between positive and negative .
hi , my name's rod , and ... i like to party .
i like this explanation . i feel like chalking the internet's love for tesla up to an oatmeal comic is a bit of a stretch . edit : telsa to tesla
yep . it's sad that people don't know about tesla inventing teleportation .
[ i still see pictures like this regularly on facebook . ] this shit is still out of control
sadly i can't clam to know much , all i know is edison fucked tesla over and was a general shit
sounds just a touch personal maybe ...
<TRNC> was very helpful to his scientific abilities . he once said in earlier years that he felt he could never be worthy enough for a woman , considering women superior in every way . his opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant . this " new woman " was met with much indignation from tesla , who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power . " yes , yes ... wait what ? no , no no .

i think i could live off $ <NUM> million quite comfortably for the rest of my life . it's always amazing to me how fast people run out of money .
it's almost amazing that more people aren't aware of the tesla-edison history . edit : there are documentaries besides that comic the oatmeal posted . jesus people , comment something original .

even great scientists can have their minds blown by the science they do themselves . didn't einstein push back on quantum randomness even though he discovered the photo electric effect ? i guess they are human too .
also we often have a flawed understanding of ' measuring ' . any atom inside the box with the cat can get affected by the proceedings in the box and lead to collapsing wave function .
all vitamins are chewable .
goddamn thank god . i've been waging a one man war against people talking about schrodinger's cat for years . people just talk about it to sound smart . it has no bearing in what anybody does , except quantum physicists .
that schrödinger did not believe in the possibility of a cat being simultaneously both dead and alive . his thought experiment was meant to criticize the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics .
i hate meme physics . so many people on the internet get excited about physics but so many people misunderstand it and try and talk about it anyway . a lot of people seem to think that schrödinger's cat is a philosophy thing and that the point is that if you don't know a property of something then it's all possibilities at once . i actually saw a video the other day of that matthew santoro guy saying that the double slit experiment is evidence for parallel universes .
still had pussy on the mind . true madlad
<TRNC> solution right ? maybe , but many-worlds believers argue that it is mathematically the simplest solution . infinite may be a large number , but ignoring the sheer quantity , it does explain away most of the leading questions with quantum weirdness with the least amount of added confusion , more questions , or additional extremely complicated maths needed . - additionally , it's worth noting , that you could potentially view both of these views as viable ways of viewing the exact same thing . so , semantics aside , the debate may largely be a philosophical one .
legend goes that schrödinger developed his eponymous equation when he took his mistress out for a two week vacation in a villa in the swiss alps . presumably one of the most important scientific developments of the <NUM>th century was put together between marathon bang sessions .
when the concept finally occured to him , he was like : " shit . i gotta make this about cats somehow ... "

coca-cola once contained an estimated nine milligrams of cocaine per glass .
the absurdity is the philosophical idealist view that the objective world does not exist outside of observation , and that's nonsense . just because we can't measure something and determine its position at the same time with our current technology does not mean it only takes a position once observed .
in medieval europe , the pelican was thought to provide her own blood to her young by wounding her own breast when no other food was available . as a result , the pelican came to symbolise the passion of jesus and the eucharist .

<TRNC> * some * form of schrödinger's cat remains valid . sure , it's not as simple as putting it in a box . you would have to somehow isolate the box from interacting with the rest of the universe . but the experiment would hold . until some sort of interaction takes place , the cat is both alive and dead . if you still think this is complete garbage , then you're probably not a fan of ci , and i'd happen to agree with you . of course , the other interpretations are all just as wild <TRNC>

i had a hotmail account back in the mid nineties . my mum thought it was " hotmale " and that i was using that address to pick up chicks .

<TRNC> , did you use your company's email system to communicate with each other ? because if you did , then this idea of yours belongs to the company , as you used their resources " . but the founders had thought of that , and had come up with a web-based email system that they proudly showed to the vc : see , we thought about that . then all the vcs sat up and get really interested in this * web-based email * idea . so the founders ditched their database idea , and switched to this instead .
hotmail is really just outlook.com now . outlook.com isn't nearly as popular as gmail so there's a good chance you could get a firstname.lastname@outlook.com the cool thing about outlook is you can create aliases . for example , you could simply add your firstname.lastname@outlook.com as an alias to your current cheetahlegs@hotmail.com account . then you can slowly start giving everyone your new address without ever having to mess with creating a new account . just log into your email account online , go into settings , and find the section where you can create an alias .

it's extremly stingy in smell , but after a while you don't think about it that much and the taste is mostly salty and pungent . i know somepeople that eat it as a evening snack by the tv traight from the can - that i cannot do .
it is likely that brutus was caesar's first son and that caesar might have suspected it before being assassinated by him .

garum was a fermented fish sauce that was used as a condiment in the cuisines of ancient greece , rome , and byzantium . it was as common for the roman empire as fish sauce is for most of today's south-east asia . because of the impossibly foul smell that resulted in the process of making garum , the penalty of producing this popular condiment within the walls of rome was death .

all the comments so far are from this point of view , but there's another good reason for why milk is pushed so hard : vitamin d . in the northern states , kids wouldn't have any access to the sun for months . vitamin d supplements are very important during this time and milk is the most common form of it . even if its been taken over by lobbyists , the initial reasoning for milk being mandatory was probably related to health .

they give us the same time to clean , but we can't start cleaning until everyone is gone from the theater , and a movie like this is gonna get a ton of people with a lot of mess , giving us less time to clean up that mess compared to theaters where most people leave during the credits . i've never really complained though , watching after credits scenes is way more interesting while waiting than just generic credit music .

<TRNC> i'm just calling a spade a spade . before ironman came out you were a nerd for liking superheroes and only a small portion of the general public cared about marvel . now there's marvel licensed stuff everywhere and these movies get devoured . you don't do that by not catering to the masses , they're quality action blockbusters . i don't understand why people have to be this defensive , i'm not insulting the movies or the people that like them . you should be able to recognize something for what it is even if you enjoy it .

yeah that doesn't make sense ... i distinctly remember there being a doorway from the kitchen that leads directly to the basement .
no , it's going to have every character in the marvel universe playing stan lee .
<TRNC> . he didn't get to choose the car over cash . he doesn't drive home with the one you saw in the show , the car he gets doesn't get delivered until after the episode airs . the show aired , and they said he'd get the car soon . tax season came and went with no car . my brother had to claim earnings from the car long before the show delivered it , so he was on the hook for $ <NUM> he didn't have . the guy probably couldn't afford to pay taxes on the house .

<TRNC> . yet , she still felt the need to waste the hoa president's time by making them come over and talk to me and check out the situation . oh yeah , she also cut my cable cord , sends constant lies to my landlord about our unit and my favorite ... stood and watched as her dog attacked my cat outside my house , just saying " that's what dogs do " as i tried to wrestle her dog off it . hoas don't do jack shit to people who actually need to have shit done about them .

<TRNC> that are super / aesthetic / that i like are this [ milanese breastplate ] and the iconic [ winged hussar armor ] . nothing can compare to the veritable artform that was armor and arms up through the early modern period . this [ drab green onsie ] makes you look like you're over prepared for a <NUM> - night camping trip , there's no flair or style . everything's been sacrificed for usability and practicality . they say " war never changes " but it has . it's changed a lot . it's not the same anymore .

i've never understood why critics review films that aren't in their niche . as in , why would someone who doesn't like superhero films be able to give a fair judgement to a superhero film . but that just comes from my ignorance of not knowing how the industry works .

how does that work if hoa takes your house ? do you get paid or is it just a loss ?
they can force you to sell your house based on the hoa agreement you sign when closing on the house . whether or not you take a loss depends on whether or not you have a mortgage and what kind of sale price you get but it's still rather shitty .
the next time i live somewhere with an hoa , i plan on running for hoa president , then unilaterally dissolving it once in power .
it's so bad . who would want that ? i might keep the house if they renovated it to be normal .
or from her perspective : the asshole who made up the stupid rule with no flexibility about playing with your dog in the yard was doing exactly that and cried when he was hoisted on his own petard . and if her dog attacked your cat on your property , that is trespassing , if the cat was not on your property , then that is what dogs do and you should keep your cat on your property .
the dollar store sells a box of wild flower seeds ... 😈
sounds like a hoa guarantees you at least one shitty neighbour anyway .
my dad designed the house . he watched way too many simpsons episodes to get it right . there's a crack that he put in to match the show ... lots of little stuff like that . i was around <NUM> at the time so i don't really remember much besides watching a lot of the simpsons with him .
<TRNC> whole different ballpark . screaming fights in the front yard at <NUM>am every week . a dog left tied up outside all day to bark . trash and random junk all over the backyard that attracts wild animals . loud music and parties multiple weeknights every week when you have to go to work . revving their car at <NUM>am . random sketchy people showing up all the time and leaving quickly , making you almost positive something illegal is happening . i'm not advocating in favor of hoas ... but they're nothing compared to a real shitty neighbor .
it really sounds like hoa's are just a bunch of old people with nothing to do and looking to make everyone as miserable as they are .
that's an obscure one , since it was removed in syndication .
yep but that's after some sort of miracle of renovation i guess . or maybe a donation value ? it sold in a majorly-distressed way in <NUM> for under $ <NUM>k .
yeah , but you know us americans . make that a rule , and pretty soon everyone will be " winning " their weekly paycheck .
according to zillow , that house is now valued at $ <NUM> .

[ here are some photos of it before it was renovated ] . edit : on a sidenote , i never really realized how spacious their house was . it has five bedrooms , <NUM> <NUM>/<NUM> bathrooms , two living rooms , a full basement , a seperate foyer , and an attached garage .

we really need to send all these religious wackjobs to an island . not any specific sect / cult either , just all of them . let them have their little theocracy way the fuck away from the rest of the civilized folk . or maybe send them all to utah , that place is already fucked .
these stories don't make me mad at the hoa people , they just make me never want to live in an hoa neighborhood . i mean if you knowingly agree to live in a neighborhood with certain rules , you can't be made when those rules are enforced .
hey ! i work in henderson , nv . i'll stop by on my way home and snap a few photos for anyone if you're interested in how it looks in <NUM> edit : here ya go !
unless you vote to change the bylaws so as to require only a simple majority to dissolve the hoa . ;)
mostly because the younger hoa members let them by not going to meetings . just like election day .
why did they paint it yellow instead of pink like in the show ? also the garage sticks out too far and doesn't look like it has living space above it . it's not a bad replica , but if you're building a simpsons house from scratch why wouldn't you get it right ? i'm so confused .
wow you need to go to a therapist . you don't murder a dog because their owner is an asshole . that makes you into the asshole . seriously dude , there is something wrong with you , get help . edit : the lady is an asshole for not disciplining her damn dog and the guy is irresponsible for letting his cat outside .

i'm sitting here trying to think of a airlines-jets joke but i just can't do it . this is frustrating .
one of the seven wonders of the world , the temple of artemis , was burned down by a man just looking to become famous . in response , it was made illegal mention his name in any way .

i think with zoning and licensing laws that'd either be impossible or at least a pain in the ass .
yup . the kitchen alone would have been a <NUM>k remodel . the whole house ? easily <NUM>k for a basic ass barebones fix . at that point you'd be making more with the <NUM>k . he made the right choice .
ah , but therein lies an opportunity . " proxy voting " is a method by which a member of the hoa appoints someone else to vote in their place . and every hoa member is entitled to participate . if you go around to the younger hoa members , telling them you'll represent their interests if they assign you as a proxy voter , you should be able to go into a meeting and effectively pass whatever bylaws you want with a voting majority . including dissolving the hoa if you so choose .
hoa gets told to fuck off at gunpoint
from the wikipedia article : " there were even fairy tales for little children that promoted the kamikaze . " anyone know of an english translation ?
poppies are even better , they are hard to get rid of , the seeds drop everywhere and are pretty much self-germinating without any soil prep .
why do it in that shit neighborhood where there was <NUM> % chance of it working out ?
even as a huge fan of the simpsons , i would have taken the money .
[ here ] you go ! i honestly don't know why they have that on their porch ... sorry , no banana for scale . just use the door
fun fact : kamikaze translates roughly as ' holy wind ' and originates from when the mongols were destroyed not once , but twice by storms when trying to invade japan . buddhist and shinto followers prayed for the mongols to be destroyed and , when they were , the term kamikaze became established .
i wonder if any ever had a change of mind and made a break for it .
in the us , its counterpart is " hello boys ! i'm baaaack .. "
could have been bought on foreclosure at a low point and they just sat on it . if the house was valued at <NUM>k - this many years to be valued <NUM>k is not that unlikely . most houses where i grew up - were valued at <NUM>k - are now all worth an easy mil .
i thought bonzai was a type of tree
my hoa voted against allowing front facing garages . so half the homes have three walled " rooms " at the end of the driveway . these rooms are great for parking your car , storing your lawnmower , etc . if they had doors , we might call them " garages " . but garages are trashy .
hoa's : not even once .
they really shouldn't have built in an area with a homeowners association .

of course , i'd assume they'd be taken prisoner if at all practical for defenders . how easy can it be to ditch without a parachute though ? if they had chutes , it wouldn't be hard at all .
that japanese kamikaze pilots were allowed to return if they didn't find a suitable target . one pilot was shot after his ninth return .
<TRNC> close to japanese troops to prevent artillery call ins . the japanese had much better morale and used banzai chavez to break the chinese troops in close quarters . the charges against the americans can also be spilt into banzai and suicide charges . in the losing battles , some commanders would lead their men on a suicide charge . edit : as several commentors have pointed out , a division of <NUM> is too large . i tried looking for my original source but couldn't . i've struck out the equivalence part since i can't verify that info .
what branch are you in , and what is your job . i ask because i just took coc refresher and i'm pretty sure you aren't supposed to try to escape unless it's a group effort or if your comrades lives won't be at risk .
or ... you stay as a nice pow and contribute to the enemy war efforts so that overall pow are treated better , like a useful ressource , instead of a burden . this encourage more human treatment .
my great grandpa was a pow in germany during ww<NUM> . he taught a guard english in exchange for a nazi guard uniform and escaped . my family still has the gloves , sword and i believe a hat
i had a chance to visit this when i lived in the las vegas area before it was renovated . it was really fun to walk through . i would have a hard time between renovating it , and keeping it open as an attraction . although i don't know how the zoning would work in this case . anyway , just about everything inside was concrete to give it the rounded , cartoon kind of look . but it was all surprisingly accurate as far as the show goes .
so , it's a lose-lose situation then .
aren't most murder-suicides ?
so ... try harder or die .
very true . probably not wise to use your experienced pilots on a one way mission .
my grandfather was a pow camp guard during ww ii . he said the german captives seemed happy to be captured and out of the fight and were very friendly . however , you could never turn your back on the japanese prisoners because they were honor bound to escape at every opportunity .
<TRNC> met his death heroically and had become a model for soldiers and pilots , said the report . the pilot ’ s deed had also come to the attention of the emperor who had granted the pilot posthumous promotion to second lieutenant . in death , like other fallen servicemen , he received deification at the yasukuni shrine . took awhile to get this , thank god for sites that save torrented books and let you download them free of charge . if anyone is wondering the author is axell and his novel was called kamikazie : japan's suicide gods

> when you eliminate all thoughts about life and death , you will be able to totally disregard your earthly life . this will also enable you to concentrate your attention on eradicating the enemy with unwavering determination , meanwhile reinforcing your excellence in flight skills . — excerpt from a kamikaze pilots ' manual makes me wonder how the author knew this .
did he try spinning ? i heard that's a good trick from a reliable source .
that in the <NUM>th century , the roman catholic church ruled that beavers were fish and could be eaten on fridays .
so the mongols came over , ready for war , and died in a tornado . but they tried again , and had a nice time fighting with the japanese , but then died in a tornado .
i've never understood what japan's goal was . was it to invade north america ? what was japan's idea of winning ? it can't have been on the scale of germany
i believe was called winnie the pooh brings death to america .
holy shit / r / fashionreps is leaking ...
* shrugs * " what are the odds , amarite ? " * shot dead *
<TRNC> this point for us . i even asked about it after a code of conduct refresher one time . i was told " if you have a viable means to escape , you try to do so no matter what . even at risk of death or threat of executing others . " i brought up another point , if they offer to let you walk away and in exchange they execute your comrades . this is seen as making a deal with the enemy and you can not do that . basically , escape on your own only .
> in the final moments before the crash , the pilot was to yell " hissatsu " at the top of his lungs which translates to " certain kill " . and all this time , i thought it was " bonzai " .
some kamikaze pilots survived the end of the war and fathered children . the son of jerry yellin , who flew the last us combat mission of wwii , married the daughter of one , who gave approval for his daughter to marry a _gaijin_ [ non-japanese - a foreigner ] only because the blood of a man brave enough to pilot a p - <NUM> over japan and survive flowed in his veins . their grandchildren now live in japan .
i just watched a documentary on kamakaze . apparently their return on investment was pretty shit . they sank only like <NUM> ships out of <NUM> kamakaze pilots .

<TRNC> instance . overall , i am very happy with my current hoa . i have experienced bad ones though . my hoa in colorado tried to fine a guy who hung an american flag outside his front door . they sent me a passive aggressive letter for not clearing my sidewalk of snow completely . there was snow an inch or so away from the grass . they also got on me for using my snowblower at <NUM>am . i had to go to work , but the city's ordinance said that snow had to be cleared by noon .
there wouldn't be much a place for them to make a break for . the americans / british would certainly shoot them down if the attempted to land somewhere . i guess they could just bail out , but i don't know if they were given chutes .
having spent <NUM> + years in florida , the summer i spent in nevada was wonderful . so dry compared to <NUM><NUM> % humidity , lol .
was this before ejection seats were made / implemented ? why couldn't they just aim a whole plane right at a target then time ejection right ? i understand it's probably just the custom / tradition of the japanese at the time but just seems so pointless .
you'd probably get so sick you'd turn yellow
ah that makes sense . decent effort making a power play when the world was a shitshow . i wonder if germany would have let them have it if the baddies won
i wouldn't say that . bombs nearly worked . if germany had a more advanced way than they already did of hitting targets , the uk might have fell and then the war would have been lost
<NUM>:<NUM>
given the propaganda in japan at the time , most probably didnt see it as an option . they were told that americans were cruel and would torture them to death . theres a video online of a japanese pilot americans try to pick up after he ditches in the ocean , but he pulls a grenade and blows himself up rather than be captured .
that's not true if they ditched and swam around they would've been picked up . they wouldn't be shot like buffalo .
to basically own the pacific . so their attack on pearl harbor was to cripple / take out the whole pacific fleet . so america couldn't stop them and japan to get them so demoralized from this attack that they wouldn't join the war .
there's always an hoa defender when i post about them . :) i'm glad it works for you . i will never buy a house in an hoa myself . even if they seem reasonable at the time , the people who make up the hoa will change , and rules can change over time . and really , i just hate having people tell me what to do and how to live my life . it's my house damnit !
i mean , if he was caught and japan won the war , then for sure japan would have punished him even if the americans didn't

california is not a resource-rich tourist destination ?

parts of california have done this as well . if i recall oprah winfrey helped ban highways on some highways .

i know lobsters taste disgusting if you kill them too long before cooking but i don't see why they have to be boiled alive . why not have the chef destroy its brain / central nervous system / whatever bit it is that gives lobsters feeling with a sharp knife to kill it quickly then throw it in the pot immediately after .

maine : there are at least three places i can think of that semi got around this : searsport , china , and saco . technically they aren't billboards but signs designating the entrance to a business , but they are overly huge signs that might as well be billboards compared to other business signs in the area / state .
where are you getting that ? i've lived in vermont for my whole life and have never heard that or seen a mcdonald's without a drive-thru .

my uneducated guess would be that it might pose a security threat to always be reading qr codes ? taking a selfie with a qr in the background ? bam someone has snuck some malignant code onto your phone that might get executed . or most likely : bam you now have an annoying prompt on your screen asking you to visit bigtiddies.com . edit : finished my sentence .

i'd be disappointed to find out that vermont doesn't have a large state budget line item of buying up ad space in new hampshire and massachusetts for " visit vermont " billboards .
calipers are only accurate to . <NUM> " regardless of manufacturer or digital readout
people with red hair are more sensitive to thermal pain , are less sensitive to electrically induced pain , and require larger amounts of anesthetics than people without red hair due to a mutation in their melanocortin <NUM> receptor .
makes sense considering these states are known for their beauty . especially for hawaii and alaska where tourism is an integral part of their economy - having a billboard covering a scenic view that visitors travelled to see probably would hurt more than a billboard would make money .
vermont is only snobby in its craft beer though . it is a odd place that is kind of just like a liberal version of the south in a way .
i don't understand why manufacturers won't just build a qr reader into the camera app .
if you're slowly reaching ambient temperature i have some bad news for you bro

yup . i'm in hawaii , one of those states . it's very nice not seeing billboards - it would ruin the beautiful scenery we have . we also have limits on how big a businesses sign can be . and on at least one island there is a limit to the height of a building .
that the in japan there is an underwater mailbox . up to <NUM> letters are dropped here by divers each year .
that <NUM> us states have completely banned billboards
i'm from upstate ny , rochester specifically . i've seen some pretty places here and there , but nothing i'd call a " beautiful vista . " where can the ones you're talking about be found ?
vermonter here and i gotta say it's pretty awesome
vermonter here . best buy in williston , vt had to downsize their sign to be no larger than <NUM> sq ft so it couldn't be easily seen from the interstate . and south burlington is the only town i know to have banned drive thrus , so the mcd's put a window in anyway and people actually park and walk up to it instead of going inside . no lines in the winter but cold as balls waiting for mcnuggets .
ah i - <NUM> in mo where you see a lion's den billboard followed by a " jesus saves " or " abortion is murder ! " billboard .
if you're between oshkosh and fond du lac , wisconsin , any exit will do
while in normal cases you'd be correct using ' an ' before a vowel , an united states typically flows against the language , so its one of the cases where youd just use ' a ' instead of ' an ' . im no linguist , but im pretty sure thats correct
save-a-click " a number of states in the us prohibit all billboards : vermont – removed all billboards in the <NUM>s hawaii – removed all billboards in the <NUM>s maine – removed all billboards in the <NUM>s and early <NUM>s alaska – state referendum passed in <NUM> prohibits billboards in <NUM> , the city of são paulo , brazil ordered the downsizing or removal of all billboards and most other forms of commercial advertising in the city .

what people don't understand is that with a <NUM> intrest for a year deal , the interest is still accruing for that year you just aren't paying it . once that year is done you get slammed with all of that extra intrest that is built up and with a big purchase like a car that intrest is pretty hefty . the only way that deal doesn't screw over the customer is if they can pay off the entire balance of what they owe in that first year .
that's smart because some groupie girls will only want to have sex with the guitar player , and he could be like " that's me . " and then other groupie girls will be looking to have sex with the drummer , and he could be like , " that's me . " and then groupie guys will be looking to chat with the bass player about lord of the rings , and he could be like , " he's not around right now . "
that's cos they succeeded , but not in the way that they innitialy planned it . the just turned the politicians into their personal puppets by financing their campaigns , in one fell swoop the got themselves a puppet and a patsy , while they themselves became untouchable . that's why america has now become an oligarchy

worked for the ad agency who ran this deal for them at the time . the offer brought in almost exclusively people who had terrible credit . they accepted them all . sales went though the roof and all the executives got their bonuses . for a year . then it almost destroyed their us business , which has yet to recover . on reflection , it makes for a good corporate folk song .

a lot of these cars were reported " stolen " when their first payment was due . whenever we had a report of a mitsubishi stolen we'd automatically report it to the fraud department for investigation . i investigated a few of these myself , it was laughable seeing regular people who have never stolen a car try to fake it in these preposterous schemes to try to make it look legit .

if you really think its republicans causing the problems in our society , you have a lot of issues to work out . every official r or d , is paid by the lobbyist's . they all say that they work for us , but none of them care about us pleabians . they only care about the money that flows into thier bank account . prove me wrong !

<TRNC> of the goddamn government " let's remember that what we are probably talking about here is the zadroga act which was sponsored by democrats , filibustered by republicans and ultimately pushed through after much chiding and ridicule of the institution and negative media coverage , in particular , by jon stewart . source : we should try not to have such short memories , and to lay the blame where it's due . in particular , let's all remember that turtle disguised as a human mitch concentrated hate mcconnell was pretty instrumental in holding up passage of the bill :

i had the opportunity to talk with a cop who was in the towers on <NUM>/<NUM> . he said that the fluorescent light bulbs in the ceiling exploded into tiny particles and tore up everyone's lungs . we talked in <NUM> , and he was living with <NUM> % lung capacity at that point . what a terrible way to live . update : i just learned that he died in <NUM>
i remember sitting in my uncles living room the day the we started the war with iraq . the entire iraqi army stormed over the hill not to kill but to surrender . what if we go to war and we all surrender ? what is america worth then ? fuck a draft
if all this sickness is caused by buildings collapsing , does that mean people living in syria or iraq getting bombed all the time are dealing with similar problems being around ruined buildings and stuff ?
both the pulverized glass and the pulverized concrete can cause [ silicosis ] . it's a nasty , nasty condition .
<TRNC> his real-world persona - was given the lowest score possible , a <NUM> , so low that he ’ d rarely if ever go out of his way to declare war on someone . > only , there was a problem . when a player adopted democracy in civilization , their aggression would be automatically reduced by <NUM> . code being code , if gandhi went democratic his aggression wouldn ’ t go to - <NUM> , it looped back around to the ludicrously high figure of <NUM> , making him as aggressive as a civilization could possibly be .
i work in the concrete industry . can confirm silica dust is incredibly harmful .
as an iraqi , let me explain . iraq under saddam was a dictatorship . the soldiers that were conscripted into saddam's army had no desire to die for him , so they decided they'd rather surrender and guarantee not dying . if america becomes anything similar to a dictatorship , or otherwise unfit to die for , then if americans get drafted they would probably behave similarly . the only reason the american army functions is because the soldiers believe in the idea of america .
is that a sister game to civilization ? maybe a kindergarden level of play ?

yeah because the ethiopians were throwing spears when they defeated the italians at the battle of adwa in <NUM> . african warfare had advanced a bit by shakas time as evidenced by west african and east african empires at that time . you can't build an empire by just throwing spears at people .
if you haven't , you should check out neal stephenson's novel * cryptonomicon * - - a lot of the plot has to do with this .
i honestly wonder about this conclusion though . i know several people who function as soldiers because they believe in the idea of america . but i also know several soldiers who believe in the idea of a paycheck and good benefits , and are totally disillusioned to the idea of america . i really think that the only reason that the us military functions is because it is a reasonable career move for many people . if it stops becoming a decent way to make a living , it will stop being a strong force .

definitely not aryan . none of them would have been considered white <NUM> years ago . they all look italian and spanish .
no , i can see it . they're probably for women who are very lonely , and just want some affection or intimacy or pampering . it's that acknowledgement , that they are worth the effort , even if it is simulated , is very healing and healthy for self-esteem .

emotionally healing is * completely * different in japan than the west . here you talk to a therapist about your problems or drown it in alcohol , there they have all these specialty businesses where you pay for an experience that you enjoy hut can't get for whatever reason in normal life and you just spend your paycheck their to pretend to be happy and bury your feelings about your actual life .

the first jurassic park was the best one because of the lack of cgi . the last one that came out looked like a live action / animation mix like roger rabbit , only with raptors .

<TRNC> of creature animation experience , and allowing his animators to smoothly transition to <NUM>d digital animation work . plus , for pre-visualization they actually did stop motion tests of entire scenes anyway . so here you can see [ the entire raptors in the kitchen scene in stop motion as part of preproduction . ] after jurassic park , he went on to modernize his effects studio , and they did cgi on movies like starship troopers . if anyone wants to see / hear more from this time , [ vice did a neat documentary on him . ]
also , while shooting the film , a female member of the camera crew was having difficulty with some lighting equipment , but she was able to find an unconventional solution that provided adequate light for filming to continue . another person on set , upon seeing the unusual solution , pointed it out and remarked to spielberg by saying " clever girl . " .
it's crazy how the cgi in that movie still holds up for the most part .

here's an example of the [ go motion ] t rex tippet was experimenting with for the movie : this was before the decision to use cgi .
the cgi in jurassic park is still some of the most realistic looking in any film despite it being <NUM> years old . it was groundbreaking and as a <NUM> year old when it was released it blew my mind and i have been mad about dinosaurs ever since .
we're going live !
shoot in the dark , obscure the image , and have as little real life elements as possible to compare it to . those are the keys of making cg look good for ages .
which is cool and all , but when you go people watching , you never see skin sliding over muscle and bone . i think we have yet to dial down the exaggerated realism , and use all the super amazing innovations to make better looking less realistic animations . there's something unreal about movies , and pushing towards photo-realism should at some point make a u-turn , and settle into a sweet spot of looking amazing but not so detailed you're distracted by how " real " it looks .
pretty sure he was a stop-motion puppet .
not just a model , but a full sized animatronic . though the initial breakout from the fence , i believe , is mostly cg .
how many dinosaurs does jurassic park actually have ? i mean they have dilophosaurus and brachiosaurus from the jurassic . velociraptor , t-rex , gallimimus and a shitting triceratops is all the rest that i can think of .
[ well to be fair , he did only have * one * job . ]
actually , it turns out that none of the dialogue was written until filming began .
while directing jurassic park , when spielberg saw cgi of t . rex , he said to stop motion animator phil tippett , " you're out of a job , " to which tippett replied , " don't you mean extinct ? " . spielberg later incorporated this dialogue into the movie
" you're telling me i'm fired ? do you know who i am ? ! " " phil tippett ! phil tippett ! we've got phil tippett over here ! see ? no-one cares . "
i don't know whether to love you or hate you

citizens in the united states can give up their citizenship at any time , becoming stateless .
<TRNC> the best solution . they do this for two main reasons : it's cheaper and it gives them more control over the scenes . the terrible remake of the thing is a good example of cgi gone bad . cracked had an article on it but the uptake is that the director did actually have a practical effects team that made some amazing models , but the director didn't incorporate them because he wanted the freedom to change angles . the result was awful , particularly since the original was such a masterwork on the use of practical effects .

na it seems more of a case of digging the hole abit too deep , he probably been bragging about it so much afterwards , ended up having to agree to maintain the bragging rights

the greeks thought it was about being lazy , or as we would know it " hard work beats talent , when talent doesn't work hard . "
my reading of it is that you shouldn't employ animals to form part of your critical communications infrastructure because they simply don't have the speed / reliability / fault-tolerance / integrity properties that a modern built environment needs .
during the <NUM>th century a lot of old folk tales were sanitized and turned into cute stories for children .
i knew socs way back in high school , can confirm he said it all the time
i saw a tumblr post the other day with tons of these . early bird gets the worm , but something something . blood is thicker than water , but something something . basically they all mean the opposite of how we really use them and all have another line .
lol , no , that movie is based on real events during wwi .
what if he was on duty , and decided to take a nap because he thought there definitely weren't gonna be any fires that day ? after all , he's the guy who slept during what apparently was the trial for the firewatch position .

" like sand in an hourglass , so are the days of our lives . " - socrates
since you teased i had to go look them up because this was fascinating . " the early bird gets the worm , but the second mice gets the cheese . " that's a pretty confusing proverb . " blood < of the covenant > is thicker than water < of the womb . > " literally the opposite of the meaning we think .
and he wanted free healthcare for the whole forest ! like ... some kind of bird or something !
browns coach hue jackson said second-round qb deshone kizer will have an " opportunity to compete " for the starting job along with every other quarterback on the roster .
<TRNC> mouse gets the cheese " tells us that being the first to take advantage of opportunity also exposes you to first to market or first adopter risks - it reminds us that risks exist in any opportunity and sometimes the risks are too great . basically , your time has value again , but this time invested in the opposite action . the quote seeks to temper advice that advocates using a resource without consideration of risk , and reminds us that wisdom and experience can save us from future grief if we take the time to consider them .
wouldn't the hare just nap on the job and everyone would die anyways ? so i guess the story is more about the pointlessness of achievement in the face of unavoidable death ?
the moral of this story was never : " slow and steady wins the race . " the real moral was : " quit procrastinating and get your shit done , or some slow-ass , dense motherfucker , who's always talking shit , is going to come by and steal your fucking job . "

, there's a version of " the tortoise and the hare " where everyone dies in a forest fire because the tortoise , having won the race and therefore seen as the fastest , is given the job of warning everyone .
maybe it was the hare that started the fire .
slow and steady wins the race , i'm a nazi and hate race . / s
that's two thirds of hallmark wisdom right there !
why not just pick a bird ?
i feel like he would still do a better job than the hare who might not take the fire seriously until it is too late . although i suppose it might learn it's lesson from the race .

that herodotus gives an account of the agathyrsi , who lived in transylvania during the fifth century bc . he described them as a luxurious people who held their wives in common , so all men would be brothers .

didn't even bother with the wording , what a shitty repost .
reindeer are one of the only mammals that can see uv light , allowing them to see lichen , polar bears against the snow , and urine trails
were trump to make that statement , it would be one of the few i agree with . the boy scouts are a rigorous group to be a part of and the rank of eagle scout carries great weight . eagle scouts who enlist in the army are automatically promoted to e - <NUM> , or private first class , ensuring they are immediately payed more .
being promoted until because you are good at your job until you are promoted to a job you can't do and then you are fired . real problem in companies .
in communist albania , officials tried to entrap practicing christians and muslims during religious fasts , such as lent and ramadan , by distributing dairy products and other forbidden foods in school and at work , and then publicly denouncing those who refused the food .
yes , we get that . the confusion comes from the contradiction with the " early bird " part .
who is leaving a trail of urine ?
i can also see lichen . i always new i had a hidden superpower .
he won champions league <NUM> times , only manager to ever do so , have some respect man .
so they didn't need that bitch ass rudolph .

do polar bears and raindeer live in the same area in any part of the world ?
this is a common surgery anyone can get . a lot of electricians get it so when they know whether they're dealing with a live wire or a dead one .
well cody just took a scalpel and did it himself . the video is on youtube and it's a bit unsettling . but seriously , how do you get the proper magnet surgery ? can you just walk into a clinic and ask ?
from what i've read , we're capable of seeing uv light but our lens protects against and blocks it . uv light damages our vision , which isn't a problem with short-lived animals but we're not short-lived .
if anyone is interested : other animals that can see uv include almost all insects and arachnids , almost all birds , many reptiles , some amphibians , many fish , and a few mammals . .
<TRNC> following a dispute about doing commercials . according to news reporter barbara beck , vila was fired by wgbh boston over making tv commercials for rickel home centers , home depot's competitor . home depot , the show's underwriter , dropped its local sponsorship for this old house after vila made the commercials . vila was fired in an effort to have home depot return as a sponsor to the show . cast members later complained that vila took up too much screen time , and noted that the show became more of an ensemble production after he left .
<TRNC> source ? i really hope you're not fucking with me
what is everyone's obsession with socks ? toilet paper works just fine and you can flush that shit
very interesting !
this is also why you should never wash your hunting gear with detergent . detergent contains brighteners which reflect uv allowing deer to see you
welcome to modern television . i've found discovery to be the worst at this . * something gets said * * say it again just before commercial * * dramatize it in a preview after commercial * * say it again after the preview after the commercial *
people who get the cataract surgery for their eyes also report seeing u . v purple haze from grocery story scanners and other u . v sources . see growing old isn't all that bad haha edit * wow this comment went crazy !
<TRNC> , can confirm this is how you hunt scorpions . it's really creepy to see exactly how many there are and where they are hiding ... the yard can look so deceptively clean and calm at night , then you bust out the black light and the little fuckers are everywhere . they love the cracks in the block fence walls , and the layers of palm tree bark . god forbid you leave a pair of sneakers outside . hard to kill too , have seen plenty require more than one whack with a size <NUM> men's shoe .
sort of . uv light causes oxidization of the lens which over time causes it to yellow and then yes , cataracts . wear your sunglasses even on cloudy days .
poor wolves . their natural prey just happens to be the only creature with eyes that negates the wolves natural camouflage .
only thing i can think is that ct scan or something which pulls on magnets or is it mri ?
here's a similar video with a much cooler video effect , imo - i saw this the other day on some subreddit here . > [ hunting scorpions at night with a black light ]
it also helps them guide santa's sleigh on christmas eve !
rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose and if you ever saw it you would even say it glows all of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names and that never let poor rudolph play in any reindeer games then one foggy christmas eve , santa came to say rudolf with your nose so bright , won't you guide my sleigh tonight ? then how all the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee rudolph the red-nose reindeer you'll go down in history ! what were the parts that i missed ?
debuting in <NUM> as a one-time , <NUM> - part series , " this old house " was one of the earliest home improvement shows . it was initially controversial among building contractors , and the cast was afraid that they were giving away secrets of the building trades .

there's a video on cody's lab where cody embedded a tiny magnet in his fingerprint and then suddenly had this crazy ability to feel magnetic fields . he could detect magnets hidden under cups , but he had a lot of fun feeling the hemisphere of field around an induction burner . i'll be honest , i was a bit jealous .
m-o-o-n , that spells scorpion !
or maybe rudolf's nose isn't red ... we just don't perceive it's true color because it's ultraviolet !

i'm in canada . it's gets too cold here for that shit . but we have big predators like bears , wolves , cougar , etc that will viciously kill you . i'll take the chance of being mauled by big game , thankyouverymuch .
<TRNC> completely harmless but super gross-looking ... the video is a little grainy but try to look at how long the two legs are , it's creepy as fuck ! ! " that mother fucker can move ! " lol gets me every time :) edit <NUM> : [ we also get to deal with these showing up on our doorstep from time to time ] my ex also saw a gila monster while hiking the other day , ive been wanting to see one of those since i moved here <NUM> years ago ! the desert grows on you :)
i miss when history channel consisted of modern marvels and tales of the gun etc . that was my bread and butter as a kid . fucking pawn stars and ancient aliens and shit . makes me livid . animal planet used to be about wild animals , history channel was about ww<NUM> , and tlc was about how shit works or junkyard wars , and discovery was about space stuff . now its pitbulls , pawn stars , honey boo boo , and fast n loud , respectively . bullshit . alllll bullshit .
i saw a show where they were talking about that . they did a comparison of how humans would see a light-colored wolf against snow , and what the reindeer would see . to us , that wolf is pretty well camouflaged . but the snow reflects uv , while wolf hair does not reflect uv . it has the effect of making the wolf appear much darker and have a much greater contrast to the snow . it was pretty cool .
well , some people do it because it's neat to find glowy-crawly things . " hunting " in this context is really more " finding and leaving alone " . others kill them to reduce the odds of their foot and a startled scorpion attempting to simultaneously occupy a shoe . but it doesn't really help , inevitably a scorpion will manifest in a location you wish it had not . like inside your hanging clothes or your face in the middle of the night .
since we are having fun with our black lights . irish spring soap glows under them .

i always enjoy when toh is realistic with their building techniques and budgets . like the episode where they had custom cnc machined curved brackets and curved rafters for a porch .
i brought a black light with me when i went to california and went out hunting for scorpions at night ! made it much easier to find them and looked super cool . here's a picture i took ! as a nature nerd from canada it was pretty awesome .
i like ace hardware . they tend to have stuff that lowes doesn't . like a staggering assortment of odd fasteners . they also had a key blank that lowes didn't have , and the dealer didn't have ... i don't know why nobody would have the key blank for a chevy colorado in the state of oklahoma . the older gentleman at ace cut me a couple of copies in five minutes and charged me $ <NUM> .
i wear sunglasses at night .
i heard that bob vila is the biggest prick that ever walked the planet .
just because you know the secrets of a trade doesn't mean you have the skill to use them .

here's a nice intro [ article . ] i don't know about the electrician thing though . i would not imagine a huge overlap between biohackers and electricians .

at least you didn't call her leitrim
norm abram apparently really disliked bob vila because the guy was basically a bumbling fool around the job site and had no idea what he was talking about . i do recall a few " well , bob ... " moments on the show that were a tad more aggressive than normal .
this show ruined my saturday morning cartoons .
i wouldn't say that . a lot of parts these days aren't user serviceable . i had as faucet leak before and if first , i suspected the faulty washer . but the washer couldn't be replaced without replacing the entire valve assembly . sometimes it's for manufacturing efficiency and sometimes just greed . my electric toothbrush doesn't hold a charge anymore . you'd think you could pop it open and replace the battery but the entire toothbrush body is sealed . any attempt to open will distort the soft plastic body , making resealing and waterproofing almost impossible .
yeah , irish place names are so beautiful . my daughter , roscommon , doesn't agree of course , but she'll come around i'm sure .
<TRNC> minutes . i honestly cannot believe just how many times they said that almost verbatim . " the snow reflects uv etc ... this camera is specially modified to see uv light bc the snow reflects uv light whereas the wolf's fur absorbs uv . therefore the camera will be able be able to distinguish btw the uv light being reflected from the uv being absorbed by the fur . the wolf will appear black against the white snow background bc the snow reflects uv etc ... " holy shit i'm not even sure if that was an exaggeration .
always funny to see a til about somewhere near where you live . used to seeing the til about muff co.donegal though .

i'm from tyrone ! if you americans want anymore name recommendations for your children how about monaghan , armagh or fermanagh .

it's kinda funny though ... before the box stores , people repaired more and replaced less . faucet leaking ? <NUM> - replace the washers . today - replace the faucet , but really might as well do the vanity and sink too .
it's interesting how home depot and lowe's didn't really exist before the late <NUM>s . all i ever saw before then were small hardware stores like ace and handy dan , and they were mostly geared towards small projects like painting , gardening , and drywall .
also , i've noticed the employees in ace or other smaller stores to be much easier to find and more knowledgeable / helpful .

inciting rebellion . viceroys . now all i can picture is zorro cutting a " z " in someone's chest with a light saber .
that the story of the mexican hero zorro was based on the life of the irishman william lamport from county wexford , he was sent to the mexico to spy on the colonial viceroy there but ended up inciting rebellion against spain after seeing the corruption and injustices of the inquisition .
