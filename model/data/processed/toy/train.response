i love how his stunt double got the tattoo because he didn't want to .
and my axe ! ! !
well played sir , well played . apt username as well .
god i hope he changes his mind about coming back for the hobbit .

" that man " , are you thinking about john or his double ?
the stunt double . i understand jumping off bridges and getting kicked in the head but getting a tattoo is awesome dedication to the job , inadvertent or otherwise .
i can not believe it took you guys <NUM> hours to follow up on a setup like that .

i love pictures like that ... especially of the really cool places like the theater , ballroom and central station . even in extreme decay , you can see the

hmm . fix detroit and encourage manufacturing or ... invade afghanistan and make a bunch of defense companies and corporations super wealthy !
this is what bad government , greedy labor unions , poor / greedy company management , and dependence on one industry gets you in one perfect storm .

are billiard balls generally actually close to the . <NUM> % variation ? or are most of them better than that ?
but if you take the water away the earth looks like a potato you wouldn't want to eat ...
i read about this in some old fact book i had that was published in like <NUM> ; at the time he had only given one of the speeches .
now i really want to see a magnified billiard ball
i have a friend that died mountain climbing . strange that we'll die to ascend such insignificant peaks .
pancakes are pretty bumpy if you stretched it out to the size of a state .
whoah ... msn explorer .
hey everybody ! this guy is smarter than an astronaut !

his name suits him well .
they should have that guy on are you smarter than a fifth grader .
til xenophon zolotas is a linguistic bad-ass . til there is such a thing as a linguistic bad-ass .
hey cool that's my homeplanet !
this is potentially misleading . a billiard ball is barely * allowed * to be rougher than the earth , but does that mean it actually is ?
nominative determinism in action !
what really blows my mind about this is that tanagra is in fact a * greek * town .
they include the mariana trench so i think they have removed the water for the calculation , if you include the water than the tolerance is probably even more impressive
as long as you didn't argue with buzz aldrin , i'm cool with this story .
hey everybody ! this guy was in <NUM>th grade !
... well , his name means ' foreign speech ' , doesn't it ?
this is a good point . i'm sure some of them are and some aren't . nevertheless , i don't think this would diminish the interestingness of this fact
i believe someone posted that one hour and nine minutes before you . it's a the top of the page , in case you were wondering :)

at least no space monsters will play pool with our earth :)
yes ! it means " someone who speaks in a foreign language " to be precise ! :)

historical earth ellipsoids : wgs <NUM> :
while earth is smoother than a billiard ball , its not round enough to qualify as one
til that a meter is defined as <NUM>/<NUM> , <NUM> of the distance from the north pole to the equator
i came to post this . earth is not necessarily smoother than all billiard balls , but rather smoother than the worst allowable billiard ball .
eh , it happens .
you know what else is crazy . the orbits of the planets ? circular almost perfectly circular . all those ellipses shit you see in pictures . total bullshit .
its a bit above <NUM> and the limit to qualify is <NUM> the first point is about smoothness , the second point is about roundness
thank you ! i bookmarked it for later view and pleasure :)
which language ? quenya ? edit : it seems it was english , written in tengwar script .
i read somewhere that if the earths surface had the smoothness of the hubble telescope mirror , there would be no hight differences above <NUM>m . that blew my mind
i'm curious why they didn't just go with quenya . they obviously had access to interpreters .
according to my calculations ... it's smoother .
if you lived before <NUM> ; now it's defined as being the distance that light travels in <NUM> / c seconds .
you just telefragged my brain * )
how did you not recognize him as professor arturo first ?
they aren't insignificant compared to us .
that's a really cool graphic . where can i find more of these , like of other states ?
well it isn't anymore .
it's all relative ... obviously mount everest is significant to any human attempting to climb it .
if you look at it that way , most people die trying for insignificant goals . the significance of anything is self derived , i can see why people aim
ruin porn is all well and good if you can't get the real thing . but if you want a more realistic view of what is going on in detroit
bullshit , or perspective ?
technically correct is only good if you also understand it's practically correct counterpart . they go hand in hand
so , did the length really change , or did it just get more precise ?
you still living there now ? lots of people move away after college . =(
mount everest would be a spec of dust at that scale ...
i find it extremely odd that someone would actually have to study this and prove this .
earth , corner pocket .
how did you measure the smoothness ?
fyi : he was the son and heir of william wallace's nemesis in the movie braveheart . i wonder if anybody has considered examining his remains to try and determine
well , shit . there goes my childhood dream of digging that hole to china in my backyard .
seriously , isn't it pretty easy to tell that this is just perspective ?
wish my mind wasn't always in the gutter .
you have no idea how much happier i was before i read that .
if your fingertips had that sort of fidelity , a billiard ball would feel rough to you .
why , it's as smooth as eggs .
smoothness / bdw = <NUM> - roughness / bdw of course every scientist knows that bdw is the billy dee williams factor .
still peanuts compared to space .
that * * is * * the definition now . if the speed of light is found to be different , then the length of a meter will be adjusted
it's ok , hitler's shit .
sort of ironic , since he was widely believed to be gay ...
i guess what i'm really asking is , whats the difference in length between <NUM>m and <NUM>/<NUM> , <NUM> of the distance from the north pole to the equator .
travellersspice is right . this is not for u . s . news . you guys can downvote this all you want , it still doesn't make it the place
you can be thankful for the post all you want in / r / news / .

how is this not u . s . specific ? this is u . s . news and despite it showing up on the guardian doesn't make it / r

yes ... i will suck those balls .
i kind of get the feeling that could have had something to do with why they did it ... so not really ironic at all .
this has made me more interested in deviations from idealized spheres than it has the earth .
thanks , that makes sense . it's pretty close to what it was . i wasn't sure if it shrunk <NUM> % or something like that .
you could have just added " was thought to have " to the headline , or something similar . it would be a service to those who don't actually click
the coolest coefficient of them all .
so , if i swallowed a whole pack ... would i have powerful farts ?
if it's hard to wrap your mind around , just think of the end of men in black with the aliens playing marbles with the planets . the earth feels
the words are oblate spheroid
what about if the speed of light is variable ?
we can't be sure , if they only measure the ball diameter
most likely they don't measure it at all . this makes the matter quite different , as efficientbot notes
oh i see what you mean : it is assumed to be a perfect sphere , and its diameter must be within the tolerance . i was thinking that if
speed of light is variable . the speed c is the speed of light in vacum . that is what is used to define a meter . so go find
exactly . still , earth is smooth as fuck , but the statement " the earth is smoother than a billiard ball " is most likely false .
dae think that greeks have the coolest names ?
actually , i believe the method was chosen so it wouldn't appear as a deliberate murder iirc . any physical harm would leave marks and there would be a risk
i am amazed ! why , thank you sir !
lister likes to play pool with planets , at least we know that they're smooth enough to work . :/ - relevant video clip from red dwarf s<NUM> * '
depends on how many times they measure it and in how many spots .
i've heard this argument before , and i'm sure it's somehow backed up with evidence ... but it's so hard to grasp as immutable fact when you think of things
the outer core and most of the mantle is plastic so it would settle down into a sphere by the force of gravity if the earth stopped spinning . but
i was thinking maybe pluto fits better with the ' other ' category
how is it in relation to a babies bottom ?
what exactly do you think causes earthquake , tsunamis , and really bad rain storms ? it's all space monsters .
i'm just going to leave this here for you .
i * guess . * i think this is a pretty old picture , so pluto probably was a planet at the time .
there we have it , ladies and gentlemen . this argument has a clear winner .
he's still not over it ! let it go bro ! ! !

anyone think the pictures look just a bit * too * neatly scattered on the floor ? maybe i'm being cynical , but it seems just a little too clean

as a lifelong browns fan - i approve of this .
as a lifelong eagles fan i am confused by them not thinking " all they do is pass the ball " is the ideal game plan .

no team can actually run the ball <NUM> or <NUM> yards on every single play , so i don't think you have much to worry about .
define riskier . it has only come about in the last few years , but interceptions per pass are now lower than fumbles per carry .
this man had balls of thunder . and art modell has got to be the biggest villain / douche-bag in sports history .
sounds like the nba without the refs being on the take .
does that make you a ravens fan ? :-/
they were the first to win a game like that , i believe
if a team had a player that could run for <NUM> or <NUM> yards on every single play they would not lose a game .
it's up to the style of offense you prefer . running plays can be very exciting . i mean a team that throws <NUM> incompletions is no more exciting than
a low blow good sir ... a low blow indeed .
i'm curious as to the contents of the ' secret ' rule-book they seem to use in the nba - - the one that defines fouls on a sliding scale
i find the nuances of a perfectly executed run play to be just as thrilling as a pass play .
haha , sorry . how does it work , anyway ? is the team described in the article still considered the same team as the one playing in cleveland today
well you can also get sacked for a very large loss , and have a higher chance of no yards whatsoever .
woohoo ! go steelers / pirates !
but ... that ... doesn't happen ... do you watch the nfl ?
i think that technically the current browns are an expansion team . the ravens are the relocated and renamed browns of old . as much as the whole debacle pains
afaik it's the opposite . the browns franchise was suspended and baltimore was awarded a new franchise . later the cleveland franchise was reactivated by the league .
feel free to check out the ugly canadian cousin . we love to air it out .
art modell took the existing browns team at the time to baltimore to create the ravens . cleveland was awarded an expansion team by the nfl , which they named
he brought the other guy's rifle back with him as proof , and then some fucking remf stole it .
the old browns moved to baltimore as a new franchise and cleveland was awarded an expansion team that was allowed to keep the name , logo , record and history
yeah , forward passes were rare . i dare say that this may have been the latest instance of winning a game with no forward passes .
dude used a freaking m<NUM> . <NUM> machine gun as a sniper rifle . awesome .
right , except wouldn't the movies be just like him , rather than the other way around ?
i know that that the team and players went to baltimore . but i was talking about the franchises . the wiki knows
every time i try to bring that movie up all i hear is ' gaaaayyyy ' from people who haven't seen it . its one of the greatest movies ever

just because the mythbusters , who on most of their firearm related myths are generally terrible and incorrect , could not do it , does not mean it can't happen

no pix , didn't happen . oh wait ! here it is .
yea , i guess with the most recent afghanistan kill , the guy walked the shots up the mountain for awhile before he got the shot .
no , i correctly remembered how they labeled it plausible .
from personal experience , that is untrue . we know exactly where impact will occur .
you don't always hit the mark on the spot . that is why you have a spotter to assist in viewing the splash of your bullet . you put the
that's awesome . you should see if he'd be interested in doing an ama , maybe with some help from you depending on his technological prowess .
i disregard all of mythbusters conclusions based on that episode they did to find out if plants experience human emotions by hooking a palm tree up to an ekg and
interesting fact : the pittsburgh hockey pirates once swept the pittsburgh baseball pirates in a seven game series of baseball .
you silly goose ! i actually posted the same picture earlier today . i'm still wondering how he found and shot his target without getting " scope bit . "
i've been meaning to pick this up ; thanks for the motivation !
fwir , it was one side of a valley of rice paddys , and the kid was hauling rpg and ak ammo , shot the spokes , kid picked up
lol i wouldn't be surprised if it were true .
i think i read somewhere that hathcock and this very gun are essentially the reason why the . <NUM> bmg became a sniping round . i'm holding one in my

why was this downvoted ?
... as in how many links separate you from richard m . stallman ?
mythbusters revisited ! brace yourself rb<NUM> , they're shooting at your baby .
it's even funnier because all the eagles do now a days is pass the ball .
whenever i hear the words " the forward pass " in my mind its always in a <NUM>s newsreel voice .
sounds epic , until you realize the opposition clearly had him in his sights . pretty cool , but sounds like he was about on par with the sniper he
i was unaware that fumbles didn't happen on passing plays , after a reception .

oh i certainly got that , i was just satisfying my curiosity . the headline set the set a record in <NUM> and i didn't think that could possibly be

it takes a man made of pure badass to father the marine corps scout sniper program .
wow , that greasy neale fella seems like kind of a douche .
amen , brotha . this post was written with tenacity .
technically speaking , he is a great businessman . i mean , how could a team be that bad , yet still have a great following and make as much
hes a lawyer from space , you better believe its true .
* extra ! extra ! read all about it ! " the forward pass " revolutionizes the sport of football ! *
i don't think that's the point . i think the point is the browns deciding to mock the eagles coach that way .
i will eat my words then . =P it seems i have upset a lot of people .
that was awesome . thank you for showing me that .
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo , we got new it dept . fuck everything about this .
there's an amazing book called marine sniper : <NUM> confirmed kills that is amazing . it's about sgt . hatchcock and his time in vietnam . relevant
woah woah ... too far man .
this man hathcock ... and balls too , brass ones .
i like his ma deuce .
the team was named after him because ohio loved him
that thing is so narrow it looks like it would gouge his eye out .
i met carlos hathcock's son when i was on active duty . his son was a top marksman in the corps also . he knows a lot about shooting .
it's been a while since i've read the book but i'm pretty sure it wasn't stolen . his command just didn't let him take it out of the country .
then they tested it again using a scope that would of been used in vietnam instead of a modern one and discovered that it was definitely plausible .
exactly ! i'd be scared of getting my eye to close and having " scope bite . "
thanks for the video ! it would have been hard indeed .
er , sorry . i got the point of the story . i just didn't think setting the nfl record part could possibly be accurate . probably should have used
you should probably read it again . he says that he went back to get it before he left the country and someone had already taken it . he surmised

it would be one thing if these real life murderers did what dexter actually does on the show and kill scum , but all of those fucks did it wrong
hmmm , i have no idea why this was repeated .
they thought it was oregano .
and california has not legalized marijuana , so they're not being confused here .
its more likely his defense attorney was looking for some kind of out and decided to play the ole blame the media card .
well , what can you say ? we oregonians are consistently ahead of the curve .
if they only had a harry .
i'm sure there are many murders inspired by dexter - and most of them you'll never know about . the show basically gives you a step-by-step lesson on how to
for argument's sake , let's assume that the senator is guilty of all charges . he has still done far less harm than harper .
at least follow the code of harry yeesh
yup . <<NUM> my state .
you would have to be crazy in the first place to want to kill anyone , let alone because of a tv show .
ma did it before ca too :) people always look to ca to lead , when in reality , its a nationwide thing and strides are being made everywhere to
indeed , most cops will bring you to jail if you get caught in ms .
he doesn't show every detail of how he cleans up . that's okay though . would be a bit boring if he did .
til that my state has decriminalized possession of cannabis .
huh , i live in oregon and i didn't even know that .
and look at oregon now . rife with crime , people laying dead in the streets , dogs and cats sleeping together !
why has it been <NUM> years since the fraud charges were laid and still no verdict ? rage .
decriminalization and legalization are two very different things .
moving back in <NUM> days , can't wait :)
or just really , really stoned .
prop <NUM> was legalization . this is just decriminalization .
it's still a $ <NUM> fine , and you lose your license for a year , if you go to college , you can lose your financial aid . decriminalization
well , in real-life there isn't really a motive for a person with no conscience to only kill bad people , since they risk prison either way .
i read the book marine sniper while i was in high school , and iirc there was a photo in the book of him holding the other sniper's rifle ,
so even if he is guilty on all charges it isn't a big deal because he isn't harper . that is kind of what i was getting at when i
and you cant spell oregano without misspelling oregon .
the criminal record thing is a pretty big deal , though .
this . anyone that kills and says " oh i was inspired by such and such " was looking for an excuse anyway . ultimately , whatever the killer names
we're also four days away from the national championship in college football , so we're a pretty rockin ' state right now . go ducks !

you saw that the tags at the bottom were : statistics , science , funny , right ? i assumed it was a joke .
there are curves in oregon ?
that's because you had two confused clauses in the same question
yeah , i noticed that . i didn't want to leave it out there for other people to believe though . i tend to err on the side of caution
hell so did mississippi .
well , the mets do wear dodger blue .
or maybe michael c . hall does such a good job portraying a psychopath that other psychopaths out there recognize themselves .

next step , sexbots .
as software qa , i feel pretty good about this
" ... software engineer was the <NUM>th - least stressful job in the study , based on factors such as deadlines , quotas and required precision . ... " wtf
qa ? what is this strange term you refer to ?
and yet " computer programmer " was <NUM>th ...
i would question the statistical accuracy of any study that finds statistician to be the <NUM>th best job .
a week into <NUM> and the stats are in ? in that case , <NUM> is the coldest year ever .
so do i start learning with python or java ? ?
i'm going to doubt any study that puts doctors and lawyers in the <NUM>s and puts two jobs making less than <NUM>k a year in the top <NUM> .
yes , browsing reddit on one screen while typing occasionally into a visual studio window on the other really is the best job :)
i want to be this man .
what a stupid photo to use to depict a software engineer . lab coats , seriously ?
that is more than just a little bit creepy . fascinating at the same time , yes , but still creepy .
computer programmers are paid less than software engineers . actually , that's the only difference .
$ <NUM> ? where did they get this number ?
you can make a ton of money programming cobol , because nobody does it anymore . it is old as hell but still used by a ton of companies .
historian at number <NUM> ? somehow i doubt this .
electrical engineers at <NUM>th and with a negative hiring outlook ? yeah , somehow i doubt this list .
qa isn't software engineering .
again ... quality what ?
there's the excitement , fame , prestige , women ... no , i haven't got a clue how that got on the list .
where you live matters a great deal . that $ <NUM> is possible in nyc , the valley , and san francisco , but not too many other places .
if you can program , but can't get a handle on how to design a complex application , you're a programmer . we call them : code monkeys .
my buddy getting his history degree will be overwhelmed when he sees this list . he thought he would just end up teaching somewhere now he can ... do ...
doctors and lawyers have high stress and long hours .
the coolest job i heard of for a history major was the guy who manages the collection of art , gifts , and miscellaneous historical items of the white house
that would be incredible . but i doubt he has the connections necessary for something like that .
i wasn't under the impression that i was replying for a rate the programming language contest rather than giving someone a suggestion , i've never tried ruby but i will

i don't think these terms describe what you are saying they do . i've never heard this distinction made before .
hey , what else is there to do when you're compiling ? proofread ?
who'd a thunk it !
" cool , i'm a software engin ... wait , what ? mathematician # <NUM> ? this list is bs "
thank you for that . i totally agree .
handsome , interesting men have hot wives . the " instant girlfriends when the occupation is mentioned " are gold diggers - it's just another problem imho .
list is bullshit . retail cashier is rated higher than architect . who the fuck would work in walmart over being an architect ?
no wonder you guys haven't found a cure . put on your lab coats immediately !
well i think a military sniper would probably require more precision than the average software engineer .
you should never learn java .

i'm both a software engineer and an emt so i was pleased to see i have both the best and worst jobs in the country .
i work as a computer * scientist * , so i think it's appropriate to wear a * lab * coat while teaching in the computer * labs * .
not all mbas are * that * bad
php nah , kidding , c is a good base
you can if you want to .
i am only joking :) just that in comparison to its nearest competitor , it is quite poor . really , you will learn many languages , so don't worry
starting pay at companies like microsoft , google etc is about <NUM>k fresh out of college .
money isn't everything if you already have it .
they are probably conflating historian , professor of history , and a number of museum / national park roles .
java isn't interpreted , it's byte code compiled . that said , i agree with unnecessary verbosity of java programs . writing java feels tedious compared to most other languages
and yet , not a single person i know from my uni's <NUM> graduating class of computer science has a programming job yet . in fact half of them from
i wear a lab coat sometimes ... they're comfy

i was thinking of warwick davis . my mind was briefly super-blown instead of just regular blown .
it's always greener on the other side . the only sound use of the coat is : warmth in the frigidity of the lab , place to wipe your hands

just out of curiosity , what was your major ? i've heard you can't be considered an engineer without an engineering degree .
really ? we've been getting incredibly hot temperatures where i live . strange , it's almost as though temperatures in different parts of the world don't reach their maximum and
so ... the software engineers are the ones taking the path on the left of this diagram ?
i think you hit the nail on the head in your <NUM>rd paragraph . this is most certainly what makes engineers different from programmers .
as a former software engineer - i agree .
yes . when you debug intel x<NUM> assembly you have to wear a lab coat .
and while sitting in an aircon-filled room with easy access to the pantry . sure beats job that need to be out in the field any day .
honestly , everyone thinks their job is stressful . programming really ain't that stressful .
is this number too high or too low for your expectations ?
i know ! where are their caps and face masks ! ?
there are beginners and there are beginners . for most of them i'd recommend k & r ) for it's succinctness and graduated exercises .
maybe i'm confused : what is the difference between a software engineer and a computer programmer ?
i have a couple c + + / c # books . should i start on these or just c . what's the main difference between them ?
programming for yourself , sure . programming for * n * other people , all of whom vastly underestimate * n * and consider themselves first on the queue anyway
well the national median salary for a software engineer ii is about $ <NUM> .
really ? the worst job ever is being a " roustabout ? "
you're welcome . also , the / r / cpp subreddit is very helpful .
and if you do decide to learn java or python , i suggest you go with python . maybe i'll make enemies by saying this but java is boooooriiiiing .
have a look through this i'm also a beginner and i found this guy really helpful .
poor king he shouldn't have been talking about the separation between green and poor and just stuck to black and white and he would still be alive remember kids never

it's as if ' dude ' lebowski went to college .
a friend of mine became a podiatrist to keep his hours normal and work from being terribly life-threatening ... he eventually got tired of looking at old people feet .
news like this will probably be used by my company to justify continuing my substandard wage .
the difference between a software engineer and a programmer is that the software engineer knows there are two different paths on that diagram .
go look at elance or rentacoder . how many of those are programming jobs , rather than software engineering ? i'd wager the majority of them .
i would have thought that it was paradise island caretaker . but coding if statements and for loops for <NUM><NUM> hours a week and getting annoyed anytime someone asks you

at my job it goes in strides . some problems need to be solved by higher ups before i can start with my work . i can stub things out
yeah , i looked it up and it seems ... fairly subtle if you ask me .
man , how would i love that ... got any names of such companies ? denver , co area is preferred .
if only that were true ...

til what a roustabout is
walmart has good benefits too .
c is procedural ; c + + and c # are object-oriented . you might have trouble understanding object oriented concepts if you don't have a decent understanding of procedural
if you're going to school , you'll be learning either c + + or java and usually an assembly class is required along the way .

i couldn't agree more ! with deadlines and software going to the cloud , there's always a need for products to be spotless and spontaneous .
sounds like it's the exact opposite here in the states . a software engineering degree requires far less science than cs does . in fact anyone with a software engineering

i dunno - my roommate last year was co-oping at a military base , and was working on an audio sniper-detection system . :)
i bet my briefing officer was better looking than yours , however :-)
please understand that i'm writing this from the perspective of once being in the same place you're in ... i'm not trying to insult . basically the egotism shows a
this is only news to some . the government went on an assasination spree taking out kennedy , king , el shabazz , kennedy , who am i missing ?
double jeopardy is a good thing in many cases .
well thankfully my boss / company owner is also a programmer so it helps tremendously . no short sighted delivery dates and full understanding of any delays .
that was in fact what came up .
targeting figures to arrest or discredit them . not to assassinate them .
that's my manager as well , as long as you're not always goofing off , and have your shit in on time and good quality , he doesn't care .
what exactly does " reverse-racist " mean ?
semicolons are awkward ; i don't like them .
well that sucks . got my ce degree in <NUM> but moved over to it . i knew by the end of college i wasn't cut out for it .
there's a new version of ireddit out , fyi . we're hoping to keep the versions churning out now , and i'd like to see an edit button too .
ok , i'll bite : how can you tell ?
excuse me , but the government investigated itself and found no wrong-doing . we have such a flawless system of checks and balances .
i think the issue is that the gov't doesn't normally express complicity in assassinations . that is what's surprising .
this is where the engineering part comes in .
a civil trial does not have the same burden of proof that a criminal trial does . " beyond the shadow of a doubt " , is the key phrase
should've gone with a crowbar , if you ask me .
not everyone hates math as much as you presumably do .
operative word : kids .
i was going towards the regular comments on reddit about getting a math degree : there's lots of employment opportunities for math majors as table cleaners .
obvious troll is obvious .
true enough . math majors who are actually good at math do something like become an actuary , and make * bank * . i'm a software engineer , but
yes , but most of the time , no .
holy shit ! i was looking in the references to see if there were any journalistic articles on this , and the nyt ignored all the allegations of government involvement
yes but in all fairness <NUM> % of zomg government conspiracy theories are batshit insane .
trying out alien blue . so far no freezes .
whoops , sorry . silly assumption on my part .
conspiracy theory ! the government doesn't kill people ! debunked !
then how come there was never a <NUM> ?
i don't always buy into conspiracy theories . but when i do , i cite wikipedia .
the mainstream media concluded that the status quo should remain where it is ? great scott !
i'm calling bullshit on this one . i'm in this industry and it's not all that great . unless you enjoy endless work , little to no time to relax
oh yeah , if we are being totally fair about it . * facepalm *
so your every project has one lead that does the design work and no one else ?
thanks alot . i appreciate the insight .
but at first you said they are crazy then in your edit you say they are corrupt ... it's not as much an explanation as a reversal ...
lbj is on tape admitting to being part of the assassination of diem and mcnamara admitted in <NUM> that the gulf of tonkin incident never happened . why does anybody
wow , didn't expect such an in-depth response . thank you so much !
thank you for the tips .
go ahead and try to edit it , it'll be back to normal within minutes . wikipedia isn't like it used to be .
there are some similarities between lawyers and doctors in that the specialty you choose greatly influences your income and time . i have a friend that is a corporate lawyer
shouldn't this have been submitted to r / circlejerk ? :D
that looks like the work of a bad se or someone who was forced to fix errors on a nasty piece of legacy code .
i was thinking of death valley : where every project seems to go in it's last month . yea , silicon seemed pretty obvious from the context .
they have a mortgage too .
yeah , you're definitely an exception . i hope you get compensated well for that extra burden you're taking on .
right . i think that is what i meant to say . funny how many new conspiracy comments are popping up here : cable tv caused autism . really ?
yeah . i know . everybody knows software engineers wear high visibility jackets .
not a book . but an online course from stanford : can't recommend it enough .
its best to start with internets - that seems to be where the money is going these days
where is " being the ceo of the biggest bank in the world and only doing things that are ' best for the company ' " on this list ?
you mean like ruby or java ?
your job might be stressful , but , overall , your career is definitely not as stressful as the careers of construction or oil rigging . software engineers also bitch
those were local chicago cops .
if you go up about <NUM> lines of management ruby / java actually translates to " internets " . if you then continue to go up <NUM><NUM> more lines of
java will probably be best bet . i work for a huge it company and java is king for many products .
take solace in your being thanked for showing up with their last breaths .
i think he has a point :
okay , i don't care .
it's still cute . edit : and to add " and no one knows " in the title is kind of stupid .
things are looking good for you if you are a software engineer who is also really good at math and statistics !
so why add " and no one knows " in the title ? english is a funny language like that .
disagree . experience counts . there's a difference between a guy / girl with more than <NUM> years of experience and a person just starting out . the employer will
i'm going to start wearing one to work and see what happens .
you either completely misread my comment or are at one of the only universities in the united states which requires any math for software engineering .
i have always considered myself a computer programmer . if you're a programmer who can't design a system , aren't you just a bad programmer ?
yeah , dunno why you're being downvoted ... . imho , there's a distinct difference between " programmers " and " software engineers . "
for the hyperbolic affect ? i don't know . " no one knows " can be used to mean " almost no one knows " can't it ? i use
as you continue in the profession , you should naturally grow more immune to the anxiety and pressure from those around you . it's necessary just to cope . coding
very romantic , that's how they conceived norton .
your telling me software engineers dont study algorithms in the states ? what a country
pro tip : money ! = happiness
i read an anonymous comment on reddit that referenced someone that said it wasn't the government . case closed .
thats the right attitude going in . sounds like you're ready . good luck !
ah , thanks . after doing a bit of my own research , it seems the closest thing to software engineer at my school is computer engineering , which i
you know people leave google to found companies too right ?
basically if you fuck up people get hurt ?
the newest version has no freezes , to my knowledge . if you do find any , please let us know , since we thought we fixed those !
seattle actually , but i commute to redmond .
can i get some citations please ? this is interesting .
i just had an interview there yesterday . boy was * that * ever weird .
haskell is also all over sites like slashdot and reddit . ditto common lisp . i'd say they're pretty obscure , although you * can * get jobs doing them
wouldn't call lisp or haskell obscure either . hell , my university mostly in scheme . cobol on the other hand ... i'd say that's somewhat obscure . although ,
one way or another , either physically injured or economically penalised .
mathematicians are second to no man !
my boss walks over and sees me on reddit or some comic at least once a day . then i say " check out this awesome thing i did "
i thought everyone knew about this . it was in the news , a lot .
i will take this single anecdote and justify my knuckle cracking for the rest of my life . .
i wouldn't quite say nothing wrong . it goes on to say : " habitual knuckle-crackers were more likely to have hand swelling and <NUM> % lower grip strength "
no ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o ^ o
you're also lucky that your manager has realistic expectations .
" less harm " is quite a bit different than " negligible harm " .
if cracking your joints gave you arthritis , there would be no such thing as chiropractors .
i second this . motion carried .
they crack your joints . people would notice that shit kept getting worse and worse when they went to the chiropractor .
what a great study . n = <NUM> . it must be true .
who else immediately cracked their knuckles after reading this ?
turns out he's from one of my hometowns too
i cracked my knuckles right before reading , when i saw the submission title . it was kinda like : " hey , thanks for reminding me " .
sample sizes greater than <NUM> are pretty neat as well .
good on you for using a possessive with a gerund !
yeah .. he was in the same position i'm in , got promoted .
i just imagine the control of my experiment . it does exactly what i think , which is the purpose of a control .
i firmly believe that there are no medical issues but when people start cracking during a meeting or someplace " professional " it gets on my nerves .
from this wikipedia article , i learned about ig nobel prizes . thank you op .
i can crack my toe on the right foot unlimited times in a row , once every two seconds or so .
i think the bogus part is that your friend could just as easily go get a massage . he doesn't need to spend his money on a " trained ,
it proves that donald unger only cracked the knuckles in his left hand for <NUM> years and in the end did not find anything wrong with the right or left
no the logic would be more like , " john doe smoked his whole life and never contracted lung cancer . therefore smoking doesn't cause lung cancer for * *
this " study " is meaningless because there are two many variables . unless i missed the part where they explain that he fapped with alternating hands , or perhaps
he's referring to the study referred to in the wikipedia article , which had a sample size of <NUM> .
tough to win a game if that's how you finish .
we need more data . your justification should be " for science ! "
i have been developing for a few years . anyone know of any good sites that will help me put together a good resume ?
the entire second half was hard to swallow . we were too young and unprepared for the pressure situation that is the playoffs . luckily for me baltimore is my
i realize this . i'm referring to the self-study performed by donald unger .
it was agonizing to watch this game . and i'm not even a chiefs fan . i mean the ravens had the chiefs dead to rights throughout this entire game
they didn't pound it * that * much in the first half . flacco had <NUM> passing yards , most of which in first <NUM> quarters .

i actually don't do business with government entities of any kind . if they don't pay , what can you do ?

even when animated , cera must play a socially awkward youth .
the poor sap was doomed from the start .
apparently , that wikipedia article still needs a citation . does anyone have one ?
ugh , i can't stand black and white movies .
i think he's pretty awesome . i love me some michael cera . have you seen the " documentary " paper heart that he is in ? i found it
what ? ? ? dude . that makes my life even more fantastical .
wow , downvoted for sharing an honest opinion that differs from the norm ? that's screwed up , have an upvote .
have really been wanting to see that ! and yes , michael cera plays socially awkward characters ... but thoroughly enjoyable sa characters :)
dammit .. til michael cera and jesse eisenberg are different people .
i loved that book in school ! i even read it again a month or so ago . it'll be neat to see how they deal with the colorization of

you mean " the giver " * * nsfw * * from goatse ? i " m not sure the censors could pass that kind of film .
ice cube also produced del's first album . you can hear him mouthing off in the background on a few tracks .
well i'll be damned . i love del
wow , downvoted for discouraging people from downvoting differing comments ? that's screwed up , have an upvote .
it's being made because a movie studio wants to make money on brand recognition . is that what you meant by " having students read this book " ? there
del owns . this might take ice cube up several notches for me , despite anaconda .

mista mista mista dobalina .

i want to downvote him for this , " baisted . " like a fucking turkey ?
i am amused by the amount of hate he brings out in people . he generally seems like a pretty harmless dude , and people will see a picture of

if you listen to " ya lil ' crumbsnatchers " on ' i wish my brother george was here ' you'll hear him say it .
i made this for my secret santa who is a del fan ... :)
he calls eisenberg " the poor man's michael cera . "
stay out of my childhood , cera !
i'm here to talk to you about dr . octagon . it's fuckin ' good shit . thanks del !
deltron is amazing ! this is hilarious .

enemy napalm incoming ! ! ! ... my entire life feels as though it's narrated by ice cube now .
deltron <NUM> was an amazing album . highly reccomended . and til title . pretty crazy considering the two have totally different flows / topics in their music .
i had no clue kam was his cousin too .. thats crazy ...
it's already being developed into a musical that was showcased at the national alliance for musical theatre festival in ny ... much potential for failure , but the music i
common knowledge for <NUM> years . wow , just realizing del's first record dropped <NUM> years ago . anyway , " wish my cousin george was here " was produced
which one of you added this ?
trolling techniques : say that bill murray has about as much range
del is easily my favorite hip hop artist . so much respect for his wisdom .
dude definitely deserves a least a nomination .
welcome to the wide wide wide world of hip hop , and all the crazy relationships that comes with it .
he'll get a life's work before he croaks .
it tells you something about the value of the academy award .
yes , mr . bob dobalina . who , by the way , really makes me sick with his fraudulent behavior .
he's so good that he doesn't pull you out of the story and make you think " wow that gary oldman sure is awesome " the entire time . just
well , huh , might as , might as well ask why is a tree good ? why is the sunset good ? why are boobs good ? joe dirt
hmm . this isn't ` hello.jpg ` ?
his time will come . i'd have to say my favorite role of his was in the professional .
wow . thats pretty awesome . i loved that series .
he was scary as fuck in true romance .
i'll never forget that movie he was in where he played that really bad guy and the hero had one hell of a time overcoming his evil antics . remember
i loved anaconda when it came out ! then again , i was twelve .
silly op , surely you forgot about his nomination and win for dracula in <NUM> ... oh , no you didn't .
oh , he hasn't ? ... i've had enough of this mickey mouse bullsquash ! ... bring me everyone . everyone ! ! !
sean connery only received one oscar in his lifetime and that was only after he'd been in showbiz for ~ ~ two ~ ~ three decades . the folks at
" so give me them muthafuckin nikes "
and way more awesome .
that's because they are still using the bulk product from <NUM>
please , won't you quit ?
o_o wow , really ? they guy's like daniel day lewis , only subtle . i guess hollywood only rewards spectacle ?
deltron zero , hero , ain't no small feat
really ? that's all sorts of wrong .
til you're in between <NUM><NUM> yrs old ...
* cough * * * sandra bullock * * * cough *
you mean besides everything he's ever done ?
léon , the fifth element , jfk , true romance , harry potter , air force one , dracula , sid and nancy .
his best work was in leon / the professional . " bring me everyone ... everyone ! ! ! "
the sentence is reversed .
he should have been given one for tip toes . / s
that sounds amazing ! one of the top groups in hip hop .
you haven't seen tip toes yet , have you
they were closed when i went last night . :(
i haven't got tiiime for this mickey mouse bullshit !
you can get ridiculously large pizzas , something like <NUM> "
that is truly earth-shattering .
that performance was excellent . the one i was most blown away by was all his roles in bram stoker's dracula . i had no idea he was the old
oldman is an actor who his very critical of the selection / lobbying process of the nominees , which is probably why he's never been nominated , but no-one this
gah ! we need to get this man more fucking awards !
this , i think , is exactly why : he plays the rolls so perfectly that nobody realizes that there's any acting going on .
you mean harry potter ? and the dark knight ? he plays a lot of villains , but i think the implication that he's limited to that kind of role
he must have thought it was white boy day . it ain't white boy day , is it ? edit : yes i know its not the same movie but
til that you could reference a precise location within a wikipedia listing by extending the url with a # eg .

gary oldman is such a good actor that people can't remember who he is . when i looked on imdb i found out that he was five of my favorite
del is one of the few rappers that i activly listen to . i still remember the first time i heard mr . dobalina ... around ... <NUM> or so
i had a similar revelation with lawrence fishburne .
mind ... not quite blown . this is still interesting though ...
said the academy " we had no idea all those roles were him ! "
deltron is a group , del is a guy .
he needs to make a movie where he goes half-retard .
i have seen many of his movies not knowing he was in it until the credits .
case you hadn't seen it , people .
no , not at all . i love his work as well . he is one bad-ass bad guy and a very good actor ta-boot .
it's all heat in this day and age
thank you i came here to say this .
how about the <NUM>th element . come on , no one ? he was great in it , not oscar worthy but still awesome .
he did a voice on call of duty black ops , thats cool
til ice cube is muslim .
hollywood rewards ego , but not always talent .
was blown away by that as well ... was one serious wtf moment .
how he didn't get an oscar for nil by mouth i'll never know .
as soon as i read the headline , this is the very first thing that popped into my mind .
this is real hip hop no no phony franchise when and by a landslide and you know you can't hide this is d e l not no phony franchise
let me guess , you had the hot dog combo and just now woke up from the few week long coma .
i loved him in chattahoochie . he's one of those actors that my wife and i will rent any movie with him in it .
a friend of mine made the very good point that with the best actors , you have no idea what they're like in reality because their characters are so convincing
no , he just plays that one character , aka , himself . not that i don't think that one character is funny .
thank you , i now have a craving for one of these ... i hope you feel proud !
does she sleep with the judges ? or do the judges sleep with her ?
i think he just won some video game award for his work in black ops . not sure though .
at the office i used to work in the local costco was always the # <NUM> favorite lunch spot . some people i worked with ate lunch there at least
so ... isn't it time for reddit to take its eyes off keanu for a while and give gary some loving ?
we go to costco about every <NUM><NUM> weeks and the hot dogs and pizza are what my boys look forward to the most . i'm in it for the free
he is my favorite actor . he plays so many wonderful and diverse characters and always does a brilliant job . he deserves an award more than anyone .
or while you were sleeping ... the movie .
our food court faces the outside , so anybody can access the delicious cheap food .
i'm a big oldman fan , but i'm curious : tell me a role that , in the year the film was produced , deserved nomination against the other actors
of course he hasn't been . he's an actual actor as opposed to someone who just plays themselves in whatever role they get . see also mandy petankin , who
if you're not already a believer in gary oldman , watch this trailer to the end . gary oldman in tiptoes .
i remember him as dracula and thinking , " this old guy sure is evil . "
not to mention jeff bridges fucking .
don't you mean samuel l . jackson ?
hitchcock and kubrick never won oscars . neither did peter o'toole .
* " i enjoy these calm little moments ... before the storm . " *
wow . i never thought of it that way before , but that seems to ring true .
and then cap it off with true romance .
i cant see forgetting that a character was lawrence fishburne .
probably not . not sayin black people have big extended families but ...
" handkerchief hat wearin .. "
you should see the fighter . i didn't even realize christian bale was in it until the credits . also , it's a damn good movie . i went in
he's saying good acting is when you don't realize that there is an actor playing the part . gary oldman is so good that he completely embodies the characters he
i love that chicken bake thing
neither has steven seagal ! ! ! rabble rabble rabble
we must see this grievous wrong rectified .
frankly a gary oldman marathon is looking very appealing right now ...
bad show ? you my friend , just destroyed all of your credibility .
they're just waiting to give it to him when the half-life movie comes out . duh
my boyfriend had no idea he had seen several gary oldman movies until i pointed out that " the bad guy from fifth element " is in all kinds of
true romance - dracula and everything in between , great actor .
* * yes * * ! major upvote for the chicken bake . i want to become a costco member if for no other reason than to get access to
" momma made the breakfast with no hog "
peter o'toole has for sure . i'm certain there are others .
del was also ice cube's ghost writer for quite a few years .
what ? ! ... sandra fucking bullock won an academy award !
ever seen * rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead * , the tom stoppard play ? he's fantastic in it . the scene you may have heard of . so great
the closest costco for me is about <NUM> miles away ... fuck you , now im hungry .
he has been nominated for a razzie though .
they sell them frozen , and they are still good . but you know they just don't compare to right out of the costco oven !
they sell them frozen , and they are still good . but you know they just don't compare to right out of the costco oven !

too bad we can't vote ...
and then ... the scarlet letter , to see the rugged amish gary with his baby mama demi .
now i know i'm pretty , but i ain't as pretty as a pair of titties .
i'm curious which performance you all think deserved an academy award ?
sean connery is dead ? ! ?
and the oscar for best actor goes to ... daniel day lewis , as anything he damn well wants to be .
til of a travesty .
speaking of gary oldman , anyone notice that his role in * the book of eli * was the same as his role in * the fifth element * ?
neither did orson welles . but hey , ron howard and clint eastwood have <NUM> best director awards between the two of them !
ok lets take the academy awards from <NUM> for example . this is a tough category : * martin landau – ed wood o chazz palminteri – bullets over broadway
til gary oldman was in the fifth element . i know who gary oldman is . i've seen that movie a few times , and it just never clicked ,
one of my favorite movies and mind blowing to see a young gary oldman and tim roth working together .

and they're pretty tasty . not great , but yummy .
i actually think tom hanks did an excellent job in forrest gump , but i do love me some shawshank redemption :( .
in all fairness , eastwood and howard have both made some incredible movies .
so , why did you change to pepsi ? :)
actually , kubrick did win a special effects oscar for <NUM> . you're right that he didn't win for directing though .
he plays the main terrorist .
hot dog and drink is $ <NUM> here ... am i being ripped off ? they also offer poutine , chicken fingers , and a montreal smoked meat sandwich .
interesting . so would both the priest and zorg both be guilty of this fallacy ?

i never even heard of gary oldman until today edit : just being honest
léon : the professional is the best version .
til costco was around in <NUM> .
til irl gary oldman has an accent . and it's sexy .
deltron <NUM> = top <NUM> favorite hip-hop album of all time . for me at least .

my favorite actor of all time . now my new gary oldman is sam rockwell .

what i would do for poutine anywhere near me . i might have to make it myself sometime .
he should have gotten an award for his role as zorg .
meh , she did an awesome job in my cousin vinny

gst , importation , weakness of canadian dollar , living in a country that actually gives a fuck about its citizens . all reasons things cost more in canada .
the academy awards is complete cuntage anyways . it is rigged , biased and pointless .
i can confirm this for the costco in long beach , ca .
he should get like <NUM> and a half for leon the professional and another two for fifth element . and then about <NUM> for true romance . is it white
such an awful film . its hard to even see the trailer again
he wrote and directed a movie called nil by mouth about life on a south london housing estate . this movie was exactly like my childhood . actually , he
probably because no one knows he is playing the characters . he really disappears into the role .
the firm " yeti ... yeti ... yeti " fuck the oscars .
nothing as good as any kubrick unfortunately .
* everyone * should know of oldman's great work .
gotta have some fifth element .
he lacks a certain star by his name .
honestly , brokeback mountain was the sappiest piece of shit ever . if it was a book it'd be one of those horrid gay young adult books .
for the blind side , if i'm not mistaken
they have carne asada bakes now too .
less credibility than the grammys
ah yes ... damn puritanical laws ! hehe
that is a pop culture whirlwind of hilarity and adrenaline .
roight bunch of cunts , those academy fucks .
well , to be fair , city slickers didn't win anything at the academies , jack palance won for his performance in the film . i'll admit that palance was
gary's real accent is very normal english .
to be fair , i think sandra bullock can be award material . just wasn't so sure that the role for which she won it was all that interesting ...
i agree with you . i'm not saying that brokeback mountain necessarily was the best picture of the year , but crash was seriously the shittiest movie to ever be
actually , i think oldman could pull it off .
it was a book . well , a story . by annie proulx
unless you just mean if the film based on the book was in turn made into a book . in which case ... carry on , sir .
yeah , that's pretty much what i'm saying . he spends so much time becoming whatever he plays ... and comes up with oscar nominations every time , awards half
that's because jack was dying .
how can they make this a movie ? wasn't the whole point that the reader along with the main character had no idea they couldn't see color / the whole
dracula . nuff said .
pulp fiction didn't change any formats . it re-introduced a genre that had almost fallen by the wayside . it was a fantastic film that , imho , should have
family guy is still on the air . showtime doesn't mean quality .
came for this , leaving happy
i have a feeling that this will end horribly ... even if hoffman is starring in it .
they mad cuz they kno u rite . seriously people , have you heard his new shit ? sucks
i think special effects awards go to the team that did the special effects . i could be wrong though .
already on it . i still do a double take every time i realize he's the same actor in so many roles ...
fuck the downvotes , i hear ya . whenever someone ask me to recommend the best love story , i recommend this one . good movie . ang lee's the
i only just watched jfk and i was blown away by how awesome it was .
what ? ! his sister is in eastenders . i would never of guessed that .
i think that is his best role , but no many folks have seen that movie .
his costume won though .
i honestly don't remember him in true romance , but that's the very reason gary oldman is one of my favorite actors .
it's a bit harder to watch michael cera movies after seeing him in the * worst film of all time * .
he is an amazing actor . one of the few that can play so many different roles . unlike bruce , or arnold .
compare the abortion book of eli with fifth element again and i'll summon inglip to destroy you .
she gets naked often and that's a quality i find to be of the up most importance .
welcome to moviefone , what movie would you like to see ? * * marlee : <NUM> days of summer . * * i did not hear your selection ,
and because they're all black .
yeah , that's * léon * . when it was finally released uncut in the us , they kept the original title , but added " the professional " as
or " you will be sleeping "
no one gets better as they go , he's been around for <NUM> years . the fact that a few songs hes made recently don't suck is amazing to me
it was a book , or at least , in one . a pretty awesome short story , bound with other kickass short stories .
he can sing too .
til that despite never having won an academy award , gary oldman is a very busy man .
i caught the beginning of this on ifc , and finished it because of gary oldman . i liked it a lot . i got it from netflix and watched
gary oldman had the best scene in that entire film . absolutely incredible actor .
i am blown away by this . he is far and away one of the best actors ever .
that's what " best supporting actor " is there for .
he really looks like a benenstein bear to me now .
his best performance . fantastic job .
you nailed it , i wanna believe thats how it really is , behind closed doors of the rich and famous
has sean connery really played lots of different types of characters though ? he's basically played either a suave guy or the knowing mentor . not much range there .
lol like not shit . been eating there everyday for the past <NUM> weeks
don't forget , he voiced reznov in cod world at war and black ops !
i bought a case of them on my last visit . they were delicious until i read the nutritional information . sweet merciful crap , the calories in these things
i don't really listen to that type of music so i wouldn't know . it's all subjective but i've never heard an exception
my favorite lunch spot is the ikea next to my office . mmm ... swedish meatballs and lingonberries .
this had better not affect my ability to procure mexican coke bottles from my local costco , else there will be consequences and repercussions .
hmmm ... was debating on what i'm cooking for supper tonight .. it's now decided i'm going to costco for supper ! they have good gravy too . goes great
and they are terrible . i'd opt for the pizza or the dog .
couldn't take my eyes off the screen anytime he was on it . and it was as though i was looking at micky's crackhead brother - not bale , which
did you mean mandy patinkin ?
that was way more than i ever wanted to know about the costco food court , but i found it fascinating .
what do you mean everyone ?
which one was that ?
cough * * youbeatmetoit * * cough
that's usually true , but kubrick was so badass that he actually supervised and directed all of the special effects for <NUM> himself . he collected the oscar on behalf
romeo is bleeding is about as neo-noir as you can get .
gary oldman fans should check out his vastly under-rated but amazing directorial debut from a few years back . nil by mouth . not for the faint of heart .
wtf i had no idea that was him .
... that was my point .
best . villain . name . ever !
i know ! that movie floored me . and it was his first ? jesus
who you callin a bunch of cunts then eh ? eh ? eh ? ? ?
wasn't he nominated for " the contender " ?
my favorite part of * the book of eli * was when he took the book back to his sanctuary before opening it and realizing that what he wanted wasn't
well , except micky ward . he didn't actually have that much of a personality . i loved charlene though .
he just goes by larry now . i'm serious .
you never go full retard .
bale is just difficult to watch for me . i know he puts in a lot of work , but i am always too conscious of his " transformation "
disagree . kubrick is over-rated and a lot of his stuff is just unwatchable . in my opinion , of course .
in canada it is $ <NUM> .
one of my all time favorites . notice his tip of the hat to his other movie that year , immortal beloved ?
the blind side was pretty shitty too .
ikea also sell incredibly cheap hot dogs and coffee . it's impossible not to partake . they're practically giving them away .
unwatchable ? like what ? paths of glory is unwatchable ? the shining is unwatchable ? a clockwork orange is unwatchable ? strangelove is unwatchable ? i don't think you
they have , but they've also both made a fair amount of unbelievably shitty movies . go watch * ransom * and * the rookie * and ask yourself why
* lost in space * was a horrible movie but damned if he didn't act the hell out of his part .
til irl gary oldman doesn't have an american accent . ftfy
interesting . imo , that attitude is just ridiculous . it's bullying and counterproductive to the us economy . maybe all the canned beets companies could collectively refuse to sell
he's one of the few that has pulled off quentin tarantino dialogue without sounding like quentin tarantino . that alone would make his performance incredible , but he was drexl
he's like the waldo of actors , half the fun of watching his movies is figuring out which character he is playing .
eastwood also directed * pink cadillac , space cowboys , blood work * etc . he's made some great movies , but he's wildly inconsistent .
what ? a us costco ? what should i be looking for during my next trip ? even the glass bottles at the mexican supermarket were over $ <NUM> /
you remember him , you just have no idea that he is the half black drug dealer with dreads from the beginning of the movie until someone points it out
i've read it was based on his own childhood , which just makes it even more horrific .
everyone ? eeevvvvreeeeyyyoooonnnnnnneeee ! ! ! oscar gold right there .
well there is the painfully obvious choice , eyes wide shut .
crude comments like this deserve more respect .
what we got here is a motherfucken charlie bronson - true romance
haven't you seen something about mary ? that was actually gary oldman . franks and beans . i'm just fucking with you , mage <NUM>k . that wasn't really him
yep , yep , yep , yep , yep . i have seen them all and i think there was a case of ' the emperors new clothes ' about
oh , so that's why he's taken on so many crap roles . a shame given his talent .
oh , god . it's terrible . but it's good evidence of oldman's ability to completely transform himself into a different person for each of his movies .
are you saying he'll win an oscar for portraying a frog ? i can believe that ...
that's when you know what an awesome actor he is when you don't even realize it's him .
which is why lawrence fishburne should play as lawrence fishburne in his next movie called lawrence fishburne .
bring me everyone . eeeeeevvvvvveeeeeryyyyyyyoooooneeeeeeeeee ! ! !
he's not tyler perry .
huh , til he was married to uma thurman .
he did for years in his younger days , too .
i just watched jfk last night . the movie had a monster cast , but oldman as oswald was absolutely spectacular . i was going to make a post in
he musta thought it was white boy day ...
same here ! i recently had a gary oldman epiphany !
did you see the long version or the american release ? the longer version is different enough to where it warrants a viewing if you've only seen the <NUM> minute
the ceo also gave himself a salary cap and said that he doesn't want to make so much more than the employees below him .
same goes for sam's club , just tell them at the door that you're going to the food stand .
i had such a thing for gary oldman in the ' <NUM> ' s , immortal beloved got me into playing classical music . that's a good actor !
i use this quote with my kids all the time . they think i'm nuts .
that is kartelling , and thus forbidden ...
which is just a shame . for my money he is the best actor around .
" barry lyndon " is kind of hard when you're not into the visuals kubrick was after and all the fancy lighted shots - - that and the end sequence
i agree the academy picks crap a lot , but the purpose is to select good acting , directing , etc . not " awesome " .
true romance is filthy with good performances . walken , pitt , and oldman especially .
til that inigo montoya was lisa simpson's future husband .
samuel l . jackson is lawrence fishburne , who is wesley snipes , while being bill cosby
* cough * * * juliarobertsinsteadofellenburstyn * * * cough *
the guy's a fucking chameleon--you don't seriously expect the academy to clean their damn glasses , do you ?
how many actors are smart enough to play a lead in rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead ?
it's interesting that three of the four actors you mentioned have won the oscar by playing a biopic .
do you boys like mexicoooooooooooooooo ?
i enjoyed ransom :( . and i cant stand sports movies at all , theyre all the same to me so i can't judge it .
the one in mountain view has the food indoors
he is one of my favorite actors ever .
i have some sort of irrational hatred of ron howard , and i don't really know why . it's just that every time i see him i want to punch
to be honest , i thought the title of the post said gordon freeman just by the picture .
nah i had no idea it was a story .
wait , he was sirius black ? damn , you're right .
i bet he is very ... dis ... a .. pointed !
yeah right , and grizzly adams had a beard .
he's been my favorite actor ever since i saw leon : the professional like <NUM> years ago . although his most underrated role would be sid and nancy imo .
reminds me so much of dustin hoffman in hook . omfg .
who cares if he's never won an oscar . he won best kiss at the mtv movie awards in <NUM> !
til who played zorg from fifth element
wow ... feel bad how hard i laughed at that one
and he plays an awesome beethoven in immortal beloved
the fifth element ! ? i had no idea he was the one playing zorg .
whoa whoa whoa . i know the oscars can be shitty sometimes , but let's not go that far .
he * is * a pretty fine actor . i guess he just doesn't do the same types of roles that daniel day lewis does . gary oldman is amazingly
badasses like gary oldman don't need naked golden trophies as validation to prove that they're fucking incredible . and he knows it .
sid and nancy - one of my all time favorite movies .
what the fuck . he's everywhere , hiding in plain sight .
what is an academy award ? serious question , i could google it , but i'd rather ask reddit .
can we just talk about how amazing the name jean-baptiste emanuel zorg is ? the combination of such a traditional french name combined with a clearly futuristic last name .
you don't like beethoven .
the academy awards sucks . i know actors in independent and unknown films that deserve these awards but no one knows them
the sheer diversity in his roles is proof enough of how talented he is .
my name is victor resnov ! !
imho , immortal beloved's role as beethoven was beyond amazing and pretty much deserved the best award you can get .
this is what i was gonna say ... i love his performance in that movie ... but i love his performance in all of them ... so let's say i
i can't believe this isn't higher . i love fifth element .
and to think , they didn't even call her up to see if she'd let them use her real voice .
agreed . she's totally still has it .
surely you can't be sirius !
holy shit , he was jim gordon in the new batmans ? what the fuck !
the professional was one of his best roles imo .
peter f-ing sellers ? ? ? are you kidding me ? what the fuck was the academy doing the year dr . strangelove came out ?
benny , bring me everyone .
* * everyyyyyyooooonnnnnnneeeee ! ! ! * *
holy shit , he was dracula ? i lost the gary oldman game :(
jean baptiste . emanuel . zorg .
my favourite oldman role !
come on , they were ten !
just get a toaster oven . sure no nifty conveyor belt but it does the trick
having ten nominations was the right choice to make ; dark knight , the wrestler and wall-e would have been nominated had there been ten nominations in <NUM> .
something i realized <NUM> years ago . gary oldman can become any character . come on , the dude played dracula and drexyl and both of them very well .
i just watched leon : the professional today for the first time , and i must say ... damn , gary oldman deserves them all .
he was absolutely perfect in rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead .
just fyi : that pizza is known as a " combo " at costco . the other options are plain cheese and pepperoni . personally , i always get the
i had forgotten this one ! plays a " little person " and he was terrific !
this needs to be made into a tshirt !
well til he was the actor that spit on joey in the war scene . seriously he looked so different than he did in the dark knight .
it's like playing six degrees of kevin bacon : hard mode
sucking * my fair lady * ' s dick .
just like it came for bill murray ?
vista , ca used to be outdoors , then they remodeled it to put it indoors like <NUM> years ago . i never really figured out why . carlsbad and
he's been my favorite since fifth element . i love that movie .
yeah they have it but it's not cheap , i think it's around $ <NUM> for a <NUM> pack in glass bottles . i'm not sure if that's only in
i shop there but never saw that happen , i only go once every <NUM><NUM> weeks though so it may have been resolved before my return or i just didn't
i know ! happy birthday btw .
eyes wide shut is a tour de force .
dr . octagon is amazing , but del had nothing to do with that project .
how is he an awful story teller and an average film maker ?
good taste ! both are very interesting indeed !
he was that dude with the messed up face in hannibal . im freaking out right now .
i think it is honestly because there is no award for best villain . if there was that award , he would have won many times over .
hmm ... so there goes that theory . maybe at one point they thought it would be a good idea ?
just got dr . strangelove delivered today . now i'm even more intrigued .
wow , i've never seen this reposted before ...
definitely in my top <NUM> favorite actors of all time . also , the man oozes sex appeal .
very true , i personally loved him in " leon the professional " . he played the part so well , it sent shivers up my spine when it popped
give yourself a treat and check his movies out . one of my favorites is " state of grace "
this has become one of my favorite movies .
vito cornelius . sometimes pronounced corneeeeeliooooos . also bilbo baggins .
yep , and from the sounds of things they are available at most us costcos . i found them in <NUM> mn locations for around $ <NUM> / <NUM> bottles
and i'm a huge fan of really , really depressing and grimy english movies but his took it to a new level . you felt it .
we have more in common than i thought .
til that he is also the voice of captain victor reznov from call of duty : black ops
they're all inside up here in soybean country . outdoor food courts don't make as much sense when there's snow on the ground more than a couple weeks out of
for quite a while now he has been in my top <NUM> favorite actors . i actually pegged him as a great ' snape ' but still thought his '
jean baptiste . emmanuel . zorg .
* cartel the other problem is they're really hard to maintain because every company would have a huge incentive to cheat .
it's a shopsy's right ?
their strawberry icecream is to die for !
what brand or what does the package look like
whats so good about lingonberries ?
source ? not that i dont believe you or anything
this just shattered my whole universe .
academy awards are for fame and prestige , not acting ability .
* * shenanigans ! * * this must be rectified ! they pass those things out like candy anyway , this man deserves at * least * one .
wow . turns out i know nothing about forrest whitaker
you're confused . not that * rookie * . this * rookie . *
" always a bridesmaid never a bride my foot ! " - peter o'toole , on accepting his lifetime achievement award
that one was really the first one i thought of .
wait , he was sirius ? what the fuck . how is he so good at this ?
many young actors have this problem . hopefully , some have grown out of it ?
congratulations . you have realized what nobody else in the world realized . you are such a genius .
rube ! yeah , didn't realize he was inigo , but then the first time i saw the princess bride i wasn't paying that much attention .
two words , jamie foxx edit : s / fox / foxx
you forgot the link .
same ! ! i never realized he was jean-baptiste emanuel zorg edit : and sirius black ! ! !
and <NUM> won in korea .
i don't think we're supposed to tell you this but , you don't have to be a member to eat at the food court .
* nil by mouth * was based loosely on oldman's childhood .
they don't check for membership at the food court . you just have to get by the people at the door who check for memberships . i don't even know
you must think it's white boy day ?
remember isindex ? and server-side image maps ? cgi-bin ? those were the days . i'm old .
i love gary oldman . all i can say is that i hope he earns some sort of lifetime achievement award . he is fucking amazing .
its all about the ceasar chicken bake and berry-frozen yogurt sundae !
the closest you'll get to an action movie is gladiator . why do we pretend the award means anything if it's only given to artsy movies that are made to
yeah . have you seen it ? people say it has too much swearing . it's true , but it's not watered down . that's exactly how people behave in
someone needs to whip a torrent up of all his most amazing movies .
you're too young to have a h<NUM>g<NUM> name on reddit .
well , looks like the party's winding down . let's take a road trip to tijuana and get fatbot some action .
man , i'll have to check that out . i worked with ed harris ' dad when was in college . great guy and he adored his son .
wow , i have watched that movie so many times and never realized that . so cool ...
one of the best movies ever , in my opinion . i saw it twice , and still didn't realize sellers was playing three different parts until someone told me
on a sidenote , ron howard directed the upcoming movie the dilemma ...
i'd gladly pay an extra <NUM> cents for a hotdog to get socialized healthcare .
i always wanted to see _michael cera v . jesse eisenberg _ result : draw
documentaries aren't meant to showcase the actors ' abilities .
i can be the gary oldman if i want to be arrrgrhghghghghrhghghgh
so what you're saying is that you can win an oscar for doing an impersonation ...
it ain't white boy day is it ?
one of the best for sure .
gary oldman in a role of a lifetime
either him or michael cera , though cera's a tiny bit worse .
i said i did not want to be disturbed .
my grandpa looks like stalin and is about the same height . holy shit .
a cool movie if you're interested in stalin's personal life : the inner circle
i completely agree , and happy-birthday birthday buddy !
so . san francisco has a new one with an indoor food court . too many cold foggy rainy days here to have an out door one . vista may
i'm thinking more in the vein of jeff bridges
wow , i guess those portraits did a good job . i always think of stalin as a huge man .
that's what i was thinking about when reading the list . i like some of those movies and had no idea of any shared cast . i feel kind of
shit . today it hit me that stansfield is jim gordon . ... d'oh !
or at least emotionally challenging . they seem to not care so much for anything intellectually challenging , for the most part . not that there's a huge amount coming
as a long time * leon * fan , i nearly shat myself when i saw him playing commissioner gordon in the new batman films .
holy crap . i've never heard him speak as himself apparently .
almost as ridiculous as gary coleman not winning one .
came here to mention this . still gives chills up my spine .
mediocre films do not negate great ones . just because * the rookie * isn't a best picture doesn't mean * unforgiven * isn't also .
so what exactly was he supposed to win / be nominated for ? i agree he is a good actor , but most of his roles are relatively minor with
oh , absolutely . i had no freaking clue that he was in both <NUM>th element and the dark knight . i loved his roles in both movies , but
the chicken bake was weird , at the beginning it was awesome but by the end i couldn't stand it .
upvote for the guy who is probably the best actor on tv these days . i say tv because he's only in every series since ever , but i know
never said they weren't suckers for the biopic .
i , for one , hope he knows how awesome we think he is .
just saw that episode for the first time just now . fantastic moment .
whatever . oldman's performance in the professional was so fucking bad he should never win one
nice try , gary oldman .
nil by mouth was such a fantastically bleak dark film . and the fact that he dedicated it to his father makes the mystery that is oldman that little bit
sirius black ? no fucking way .
" hitler vs . stalin " comic translated in to english .
oh ... now that just can't be right .. i feel a disturbance in the force .
the closest they get is when they are leaving the phloston hotel and waiting for the elevator , soon as they get on zorg comes out of the next one
it's been like that for ages . it'll possibly get worse when spain loses their <NUM> point year . real story is that germany is higher than italy . but
first day i had my drivers license , i went to costco for a chicken bake . i got turned away for not having my card :(
at first i was like : <NUM> , then i was like :(
yeah , but it was still one of the best films of <NUM> , pans labyrinth was the best film that year imo .
well the nominatees that year is rather terrible . but among those i would have picked letters from iwo jima , the whole structure of the movie is more tied-together

til gary oldman = sgt . reznov . mind blowing .
my wife and i use it all the time too . everyone thinks we're nuts too :(
nine ! nine ! nine nine nine nine nine nine !
that's when i gave up on the oscars . erin fucking brokovich ? gtfo !
inception will win best picture this year .
luckily she chose life .
i loved ' pan's labyrinth ' , but it wasn't as good as ' the departed ' or ' the lives of others ' which beat it out for best
do you honestly feel that any more than two spanish teams can win the league , or even the cl ?
yup , i hadn't noticed either . i like him more and more now :)
excellent movie . couldn't disagree with you more .
good actress . quit hating .
are you gay or straight ? and how old are you ?
well , no spanish team have a chance of winning the premier league , so your are right . and your argument is invalid if you do not thing the
also good in ' in the bedroom ' . upboat for mentioning mira , she was hot but never cool .
that's like <NUM> cm !
this thread just wants to make me upvote gary oldman . wish i could . :/
denzel and halle won oscars at the ceremony amy sedaris famously referred to as ' showtime at the apollo ' .
al pacino is not talented ? really ?
* neither * * has * * peter o'toole * he's not dead yet !
premier league money for reference
he didn't shoot them , he had them shot .
yeah she clearly should have won for the net . i was ok with them giving it to her just because they so clearly snubbed her with the net back
imo , in terms of taste and sheer size , costco pizzas were great for lans .
what would he have been nominated for ? " the professional " ? " true romance " ? he is a good actor , but he has never had a
i just finished that movie a few minutes ago . absolutely wonderful , i wish it had got more attention .
no , what i'm saying is that you can fit a role perfectly without having acted out that role perfectly . a good analogy would be the jack-of-all-trades : capable

i disagree , i loved * the replacement killers * , and she managed to be hot and cool in it . it wasn't a great film , but it
worddddddd i didn't recognize him at all in the fifth element ! ! !
they do not do this anymore . at least not at the few costcos near my house in cali . the only reason why they have people standing at the
what role would you nominate him for ?
like the hero of skill in fable <NUM> ?
true , most teams prefer higher league position than anything in europe , which is because , the regular english tactics fail , when they come to europe .
it's a damn shame . gary oldman is the coolest .
state of grace is the gary oldman film .
i love eyes wide shut .
and i won't be able to tell it wasn't really a frog until i read about it on the internet later .
i love how you til'd a wikipedia snippet that is tagged as citation needed .
del apparently also ghostwrote a good part of cube's first few solo albums .
this is probably not a good thing ...
this is what actually got me through college . that and top ramen .
not even a nod for his role in the professional ?
right , of course .
well . aren't you the cuddliest !
i think there's a fair bit of evidence against the hypothesis that you're stupid , ninjababyjesus . what he means to say is that you're evil .
lord of the rings ?

eyes wide shut is a tedious soulless trite muddle .
i met him and christian slater and joan allen years ago when i was working at a movie theater . i bummed a smoke off joan allen and chatted it
why do you think they keep making them ?
should have been nominated as lee harvey oswald in jfk .
well , no , she actually won it because she was amazing in children of a lesser god . was she better than kathleen turner or sigourney weaver that year
to be fair , harry potter , lotr and twillight are book adaptions . they still would've been made even if the first movies hadn't been that sucessfull .
reaaaaally ... well then ... looks like i know where * * i'm * * going for lunch .
lotrs is scifi ? but don't get me wrong , it's a good example , i'm just saying that if you calculate the total number of dramas that have won
i have never had my hopes so swiftly rocketed into orbit only to be just as quickly buried into the earth .
as a son of costco members , i can attest to this .
i doubt it ... if the first harry potter movie had flopped they wouldn't make <NUM> more after that . maybe one but not five .
i always like to think about the first unfortunate fellow that had to eat one for everyone else to know they were poison . history is filled with unknown ,

there's a theory out there that intelligent people were the ones more likely to kill themselves by eating poisonous mushrooms . here's a link to the article .

the hot dogs are <NUM> % bigger than the hebrew nationals they previously sold . the ingredients haven't changed . they probably just don't have well trained food court employees
europa league has much less significance than the cl . and for the past few years , the semi-finals of the cl have been dominated by english teams .
yes , it's an aggregate of the most recent seasons
at least it tastes good .
you can apply that to every chemical / fruit / mushroom / animal / plant in the world . think about it ...
well shit me in the bitch , i didn't know avatar grossed so high .

napoleon was of average height for his time .

obligatory fake trailer for titanic ii :
you joke , but it's probably true .
haha , i like that movie . are you sure you have never seen a worse movie than that ? how come you dislike it so much ?
this is because all they make these days is sequels and all of the movies are since <NUM> basically because of inflation .
the thing about eating wild mushrooms is you have to know what you're doing . as an amateur mycologist , i stay completely clear of amanitas in general .

ah , very interesting . i may have to rethink everything now . maybe it was the village smarty pants that always got bit in the ass .
there also has to be a positive result sometimes . like who first thought of eating a lobster ? " oh , look ! a giant sea roach ! i
okay , costco is sounding better and better . there must be some dark secret .
this is why i'm glad i have a painting of a sad crying clown in an iron lung .
i am surprised he wasnt at least nominated for his acting in bram stokers dracula and / or the professional . he played a really good villain in the professional
i meant it was a story because it's actually different . england has been ahead of spain for few years now .
some costcos have the food court on the outside . the one on lawrence or alameda in the south bay area both have food courts that require no costco member
i said the same thing ! i figured the smart villagers would probably just get someone else to try things out .

i can't think of any survival advantage that looking like non-poisonous mushrooms while actually being poisonous would convey . perhaps being eaten , killing what eats you , then having

it's pronounced nu-cu-lar . nu-cu-lar .
at three mile island , if the operators let the safety measures kick in , there never would have been a disaster .
smaller nuclear explosions ? that is an incredibly misleading description . that is the equivalent of calling the heating element in any device an ' explosion ' .
i don't think that us military reactors , at least , are high enough enrichment . i don't have any sources other than my own training , though , so
i knew a girl in a iron lung :P she always had a sad expression ... though she died a few years ago
no , bombs work by generating a lot of heat and causing rapid expansion . fission is a means to generate heat , just like the chemicals in a match
... how do they work ?
no ... one is chemical , one is nuclear , one is electrical . they are all very different things . that would set the electric heating element on equal
point is , a nuclear reaction is a nuclear explosion . even if it only involves the splitting of one atom . explosions are simply exothermic reactions , and a

tyl also that a chernobyl-like incident in the united states is impossible .
we need to find out who invented alcohol and build a monument to him . i don't care what ancient tombs we must explore or artifacts we must uncover !
that was a hoot !
the oil leak in the gulf would also never have happened had safety regulations been followed . our corporations are known for gross disregard of public safety .
explosion , detonation , conflagration , combustion all have specific scientific definitions . they are not synonyms . sedaak is correct here . for the record , i work at
we are thankful for our iron lung
that being my reservation . the technology may be sound , but the only thing keeping nuke plants from pulling the same dangerous corner-cutting crap is that everybody is so

what would be the point of a poisonous organism disguising itself as non-poisonous ? i thought poisonous organisms tried to be super eye-catching so that their image would garner a
being an operator at a nuke plant in the us , i can assure you the standards of which we follow far surpass those of the oil industry .
this is why we have more control rods and why we don't move them by hand ...
harrison ford . badass of badasses .
robin was gay in that movie too .
i know . but it's still an interesting read . kinda keys you in on the fact that the need for fail-safe designs wasn't always so apparent . just don't
as kenotron mentions above , it could also be a reverse scenario . a perfectly safe mushroom over time changes to resemble the poisonous one .

i think in the long run it is still going to be the answer .
no , i sold all my college textbooks the next semester
you know , prince william is an actual rescue helicopter pilot . he and his wife live in a small cabin in the country so that he can be close

i learned this a while back on cracked .
unless she dyes the hair on every part of her body ' hair ' should be an id not a class , and for semantics sake it should be more
it's the helicopter that made the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs
so did he volunteer for search and rescue , or is it a mandate of becoming a pilot ? the article seems to make it seem as if he has
brb going to wyoming to punch a bear in the face
it has implications for the leagues , but it really shouldn't be used as a guide for anything else . it is even more useless than the fifa ranking system
it's too bad you won't live , but then again , who does ?
i could watch any game in epl or bundesliga , not so sure about serie a ) or la liga . the attendance figures agree as well .
that movie killed my childhood . it was the first occasion where i walked out of the theatre , all of <NUM> years old , wondering how they could make
there was an interview with some kid that he rescued in national geographic world about <NUM> years back , i was very jealous .
they ask him because he'll apparently do it for free--it saves the cost of hiring a private pilot according to the article .
it'd be worth breaking both ankles , and wrists , and stitches ... and more . ~ sigh ~ i had my picture taken with his wax replica on my
anything is possible in wyoming .
i really hope they protect the interior of the helicopter from the sun's harmful uv rays with this
i usually start class or id selectors with a lowercase letter
i hate that i found this so accurate and funny . have an upvote
it sure beats tatooine .
he can rescue my mom any time of the day .
this tickles me in a way that if loretta tickled me , i'd say , " oooh , that's niiiiice . "
possibly , the worst way to meet a celebrity , ever .
i wonder if he's ever rescued a jackass only to kick them out when they're done while he shouts " get off my helicopter "
it's not a mandate for becoming a pilot . he did it on a volunteer basis .
not very often do these comments make me laugh as much as this one . upvote han fuckin ' solo , man .
lucky he can stick a crash landing cuz ... no more parachutes !
i wonder if he ever hums " the raiders march " while flying a rescue mission ?
i'm from wyoming and it is a great state ! jackson is a cool place to live , lot's of celebs have homes there .
yeah what a dumb ass , who would want to live there :
for some reason i read this , multiple times , as " til in wyoming it is possible to be arrested by harrison ford flying a helicopter . " perhaps
get in my plane !
not until he had to get out and push .
now that's an interesting wikipedia article .
i don't know if it is possible for a headline to get any better .
i finally escaped after <NUM> years there .
in the sense that anything is possible at zombo.com , sure .
that should be some type of promotion for wyoming . we got han solo !
possible ... but not likely !
that's a lot of white flesh gettin hit with some high altitude radiation . don't forget that sunscreen !
yeah , they don't realize that light is electro magnetic radiation .
mostly he just flies it to private parties
hah that came to my mind as well .
yes it will go somewhere , into another reactor . many countries already reprocess their nuclear waste .
queen to be in like another <NUM> years when charles finally croakes
do they play the indiana jones theme song on loud speakers attached to the helicopters ? i'd pay to see someone rescued in that manner .
charles will never be king .

you rescued me in that thing ? you're braver than i thought !
sad to see harrison ford end up like this ! i remember him in his heyday , climbing onto the rotor of his helicopter and punching villains off , while
if we used nuclear power instead of oil , bp would be a nuclear company . with the same practices , you can be sure .
yes , but how fast can the helicopter do the kessel run ?
i think this was more about clooney making a point than how he actually played the character .
til he was also in spongebob
great , kid . don't get cocky !
i guess that guy was about to become a permanent resident .
well , he's braver than i thought .
so long as he doesn't try any stunts .
i'd like to think he secretly nicknamed one of them after the falcon ...

i've never played this game , are these cutscenes ? ...
til harrison ford shares a hair dresser with d . j . conner from rosanne .
no , the pc version comes with a film editor where you can shoot scenes and edit them into a movie
it's like that scene in raiders of the lost ark where the natives are chasing indiana jones and indiana has the plane waiting in the river .
chewie , shut him up or shut him down !

this crash scene kinda dropped my jaw a little bit :
i love that the thumbnail doesn't show a face .
no one will ever believe you !
i really don't think harrison ford likes to make * any * reference to han solo .
this is one of the more epic " pics or it didn't happen " there's a subreddit idea , actually ... people can only post pics of things that nobody
don ´ t know about you guys but i ´ m gonna dress up as injured chewbacca and get lost in wyoming woods .
loosely-related , this reminds me of the " mario / gta " mix-up that someone did
i bought a shirt from there just so i could say i owned something from j . peterman .
he had better show up in either a han solo or indiana jones costume .
he also does the voiceovers for one of our local radio stations here in st . louis : it's alllll about the variety
let's just say a nuclear engineering student that doesn't know how fission works better go ahead and change over to marketing .
imagine when l . a noire comes out , it'd be nice to see him make something similar with that .
ya i thought about it as i typed it ... i was like " i should be more specific ... nah this will do fine no one will say anything
i'm disappointed i haven't seen any shops in the comments . :/
get my album , i'll show you how it's done , delatocious . hella atrocious with vocals .

lies . roman was far more concerned with " amerikan teetees . " big ones , at that .
damnit , now i have to go buy the pc version .
an amazing effort tarnished by a boring story , stilted dialog , and awful voice acting .
no offense but you double barrel buckshotting yourself in the face would have sounded better ... smoke some weed first next time ...
tragic - his life's work was left * incomplete *
he discusses it in this interview :
" stewart had wanted to play the title role since the age of <NUM> , so he and director jude kelly inverted the play " - he probably said to
it was supposed to be the scottish play , but they found the line , " out ! out ! damned spot ! " to be very awkward to say
that's damn cool . edit : til patrick stewart was a fan of red dwarf .
you know what they say about that line between genius and insanity . it's incomplete .
skip ahead to about <NUM> minutes , but the whole thing is worth watching .
" insanity " in action
today i also looked at the main page of wikipedia :)
thanks , this is amazing . " hey , this was your fucking idea . " lol
for any red dwarf fans , the guy on the left is robert llewellyn , the guy who played kryten . * edit : oops , i commented before i
was on it last year with a couple who strangely enough had just been married and where going on it in their wedding outfits !
is there any way i can watch this ?
having been to the stratosphere , and seen these rides in action , i can safety attest that they are in fact quite terrifying . imo , x-scream is even
i went on those rides on the stratosphere mostly as a dare to myself . the insanity ride almost did me in . it's here that i learned that when
that is sir patrick stewart to you
i recently got godel escher bach ... going to try to get through that . we'll see how that turns out haha
in one of the red dwarf bonus features , he talks about the first time he flipped on the tv and saw red dwarf , he had the phone in
til who kurt gödel is .
guess how he handled the costume design .
my daughters and i rode insanity last summer . we ride a lot of thrill rides , and it wasn't all that scary . crappy cameraphone pic .
i rode the high roller before it was decommissioned . it was pretty neat , but not that scary .
stratoxscream looks friggin scary !
patrick stewart outside of star trek ? now i've seen everything .
i saw kate mulgrew in antony and cleopatra recently in hartford . it was a great performance . i definitely only went because of star trek .
pictures of the transformation :
" is there nudity in it ? "
i guess it was complex enough .
at first i was thinking you were talking about french stewart and i was taken for quite the loop imagining the possibilities ...
so he ... reversed the polarity ?
i went on the x-scream , seated at the very end . it's a funny sensation to think you're about to be tossed off a building .
i definitely agree with x-scream being more terrifying . feels like you're going to shoot off the side of the building .
did they change the line to " even now , now , very now , an old white ram is tupping your black ewe . " ?
that's <NUM>mph ? i was hoping there was like a rail attached to the side of the top-like structure at the top , and you went spinning around the whole
i went up to stratosphere to try these rides but i got rubber legs and changed my mind when i got up there .
scariest thing i have ever done is that ride . i went at night and was the only one there . wanted to sit in the back but the bastard
kinda like this : i think the old ride was better .
agreed - the x-scream is truly terrifying , especially if you're sitting right in the front seat .
all the rides are made slightly more terrifying when you know the tower caught fire during construction . i met a guy who forever goes out of his way to
i thought it was a neat show , but it was really short-lived , as i recall . but i knew that , back in the <NUM>s , there was
i'd completely forgotten that he was in lynch's version of dune from the <NUM> ' s until rewatching it the other day . awesome stuff .
i went on x-scream a few years ago and it dwarfs the others in terms of fear produced .
am i the only one that learned this by watching the episode of always sunny in philadelphia ?
i'm not sure how much i'd have to be paid to go on those , but it would have to be a hell of a lot .
ok , that triggered my fear of heights , and i'm sitting in a chair in a basement .
til the lucky <NUM> is modeled after a meatsphere casino .
til people that grew up with computer generated images don't realize how recent the technology really is .
here's a picture of my friends and i riding the big shot last year . it's a quick thrill , but so is everything else in vegas .
haha , yeah , those lines in the background were cutting-edge computer animation in the mid / late <NUM> ' s !
loved that show . even though it was short-lived .. when i see him in eureka .. i still see max in my head
actually that photo looks fucking awesome .
read the article . the lines were cel animations like the animations in the hitch hikers guide to the galaxy . hand drawn .
and he couldn't prepare his own food ... why ?
yeah , i'd love to see that
i just did all three of these earlier this week , and i can say they are most definitely terrifying and awesome .
he always has . he was a shakespearean actor well before tng .
you will read all comments in captain picard's voice .
" mommy , ohh god , mommy , aaaaaahhhhhhhh , stop it , aaahhhh , no , no , no , mommy " interesting . very interesting .
took an order from him over the phone from the flower shop i work at a few weeks ago . i didn't know he had an accent , either ..
i remember when toy story came out and everyone flipped . " oh my god they made the whole movie on a computer ! "
i never thought i was afraid of heights till i went up the stratosphere . the fact that those rides are up there are redonkyless !
i'm still wondering how those people hijacked that signal
matt frewer was in eureka and watchmen ... just fyi ... good shows
they copied the space needle . they are literally of the same unusually high quality .
i went on all three , insanity broke my mind . it is very aptly named .
it's too late ... i've already seen everything .
i had the good fortune to see both those two shows . my wife actually signed up to be a season ticket holder with the theatre so she could score
i rode the tower ride thing on top of the stratosphere . it wasn't that terrifying , but it's the highest i've ever been with out drugs .
i've ridden the insanity and i must say it is the single most frightening thing i have ever done in my entire life . next to dating a crazy chick
i came here to post that . it's very freaky , and someone did an ama about it recently .
your username and this post is rather disturbing .. =)
this is why it pisses me off when everyone goes on about how intelligent arrested development is . this show was so much better .
this devastated me back in high school . after watching gypsy , and hearing natalie wood suck , it changed my appreciation for west side story . this woman ,
this is actually normal in australia .
nah , i rather appriciate having my mistakes corrected .
... and body double for an aged glenn close .
this was an entire day in my musical theatre history class . and then i met her . she's awesome .

i seriously love patrick stewart for all sorts of reasons . this just got added to my list because it sounds cool :)
even odder is andy williams did the singing for lauren bacall in to have and have not .

thank you for being a friend !
did you know where he got his name from ?
umm yea there is no proof in that statement . while he may have done it , saying he murdered someone without actual proof is pretty bad .
with their serial-rapist quarterback , huh ?
no , he was accused and then the charges were dropped . donte stallworth killed someone
fyi ray lewis and roethlisberger had the same lawyer .
the red button is pure gold .
remember , ray lewis was accused of murder , and then cleared . in fact no one has been charged with it .
this is a quote that i will surely pass along without bothering to verify it because it's just that awesome .

i've seen some hot ff characters in my day . * hmmmm , white mage *
it's simple really , just like human females excrete an egg every month , chickens do it everyday .
<NUM> chain combo ! <NUM> demolition dollars achievement unlocked : traffic molester !
so much truth in this comic , it hurts
do you design laser-equipped robotic sentries ? it must be some military-speak to call terrorists " patients " .
and i'm sure william mulholland would also have enjoyed this comic .
is this why most tv shows are set in doctor or legal offices but practically none in an engineering lab ?
awesome comic but now everyone in my house wants to know why i just yelled " fuck yeah ! " .
if they have blue hair ... mmmmmm
... ... * hahahahahahahaha * in other news , i feel like an idiot for not knowing this .
now that's some classic smbc .
i explained this to my niece a little while ago . a lot of people don't know this , don't feel bad .
you can totally be a network engineer , though ! really .
they're too busy competing for the high score .
don't feel bad , until a short while ago i also thought the roosters had to " do something to the eggs " to make chicks . then i realized
engineer : that bridge i designed just collapsed and killed <NUM> people . i was sure i had thick enough supports . what have i done ?
you're living the dream , my friend .
i've heard of derp .
til his name is actually rae l wiggins .
herp = hazard of electromagnetic radiation to personnel . hero = hazard of electromagnetic radiation to ordinance .
crossed a wire inside a microchip ?
i completely forgot about that . damn funny .
right . they really are * * eggs * * , not embryos .
the best part is when she doesn't believe you , so she says " well , if it's true , let's have sex now . "
you didn't find the _nude raider _ site back in the day ? or any sites with a woman dressed as lara croft ?
that doctor looks like sanjay gupta .
i would be freaked out if i were eating an undeveloped embryo .
personally i don't really care . but that is the advantage of producing something that at best makes the world slightly more efficient .
the problem ? both men and women need to stop being cowards , start communicating and then ...
i was about to say " i don't " too but then i remembered lara .
raised chickens for a while and got this question all the time ... you're not in the minority for sure
they are just chicken ovaries
here's another diagram describing how girls are predisposed against sex because the abundant supply of unwanted male attention is nauseating and theoretically disgusting beyond limit .

i recall an excellent magic school bus episode on this very subject , which clears up the " whole egg thing " . it might be of interest to you
century eggs . what . the . fuck .
i have determined that all engineers are autistic , to what degree is the only relevant thing .
derp = danger of electromagnetic radiation to personnel .
also , when hens are slaughtered the unlaid or immature eggs are removed and are used in dishes by various cultures around the world .
ctrl-f " credit " = nothing engineer is credit to team !
today i learned about balut . nsfl . o_o
they are chicken menstrual waste . you are eating chicken maxi pads .
sounds like he works on laser eye surgery machines .
chickens produce eggs whether there's a rooster around or not . how do i know this ? i grew up on a farm . i'm sure i'm in the minority
exactly xd i thought most people knew this ... i used to always joke with my sister that we were eating " chicken period . "
oh man ... its just like seeing myself using my ipad or psp in bed every night ...
a lawyer worrying about moral dilemmas ?
problem is the different languages men and women have .
that's running a flight control computer .
no you are not . my whole extended family things when you eat a egg you are killing a baby chicken .
yeah so true . it is a funny comic and all , but i definitely lose sleep over my engineering career ... and i don't even work on stuff where
dunno , but my first thought was that you just wanted to pun on foul / fowl consummation .
would have made an even better red button .
herp / derp = = cancer .
everything i need to know i learned from magic school bus .
you're no egg-head , that's for sure
same here . i thought this was one of those things that everyone learns in grade school .
oo , oo , my turn . remember , tiger woods had dirty affairs with like a <NUM> bijillion women ... all while being married . and he still rich
oh you sociopath , you .
even if both had " friends " , one would be a strict subset of the other .
fowl consummation eh ? with a vocab like that you must be fairly smart .
i also grew up on a farm .
a little late , but depending where you are , boars head tooth , hen of the woods , and chicken mushrooms are all very distinct and tasty !
does rubbing one out to dr.robotnik make me gay ?
i spent a good <NUM> minutes trying to explain this to my friend last night ...

and why exactly were you looking that up ?
lame in soviet russia joke
bad ass /= crazy shut in

i used to be a big fan but the magic kind of tied with toxicity and the fact that they are the worst band i've ever seen live . they
came here to say this . lol wtf ?
til that bands that formed and eventually broke up after i stopped caring about music are apparently having reunion concerts making me feel old as hell .
they were genius in the studio . never saw them live . perhaps we'll get lucky and they'll create a worthy album ?
the sixties were awesome - lowest known point in the ocean , the moon , free love etc ...
why would they use gasoline for bouyancy ?
and i'm going to see them

i really hope you see the irony in citing wikipedia as evidence against a myth .
why didn't they just buy the goddamned recipe ?
having been to mt everest base camp i can verify this . / i've actually been to both base camps , tibet and nepal ;)
and if their law enforcement is anything like the uk's , the act of downloading it from the internet will be legally considered distribution , since it makes a copy
til that people believe kobe beef is beer fed and massaged .
gasoline is lighter than water ?
so are many other things . why gasoline ?
kobe's * women * , on the other hand ...
these guys had nerves of steel . so much scarier than being in space .
cause homemade baskin robbins ' banana nut ! = baskin robbins made baskin robbins ' banana nut if you are already both bananas and nuts .
i read that in snaggle pusses voice and it made me chuckle hard .
i've heard they they are just kept in smaller roaming areas and fed very well so that they do not wander around and let their muscles become rigid .
i think it's interesting that there's a distinction between kobe beef and kobe-style beef . i wonder what it is that all those restaurants in vegas are selling .
in soviet russia , minors abuse you !
came here to say this . when you buy a hotel instead of a good set of blinds , you might have a problem . there's a man who learned

not to mention being directed by david lynch
yet it still says intercourse results in the majority of infections . til everyone else is having way more sex than i thought .
what ? can we trust wikipedia on this one ?
i don't know why i knew this before , but i did . still probably want to wrap it before you tap it though :p
what what its higher in the butt
i was off by <NUM> % :(
strange , i was just reading this same article the other day after watching the movie for the first time . i was a bit disappointed by the whole second
i put papercuts all over my donger to ensure successful transmission .
hiv is a blood-borne disease so getting it from saliva / other secretions is less likely than from a used needle or contaminated blood .
i'd like to see stats specifically for more modern nations . i'd assume most of the infections from blood transfusions occur in africa .
nice try , aids .
perhaps even more incredible is that children born to hiv infected mothers have only <NUM> % chance of getting it . not sure how that works .
but once you go anal it's full retard ?
the placental barrier is a pretty incredible thing .
which usually means you can attribute a significant portion of the reason for our existence to it's incredibility .
eeeeee ! ! ! hideous mental image .
that's still too much .
goes up to <NUM> % according to wikipedia . that's <NUM> times the risk but still lower than i thought .
<NUM><NUM> in <NUM> chance : i wouldn't take that bet .
* cough * just the way god intended * cough *
this may be the worst comment i have ever read . upvoted .
it's got a source for each number , i'm pretty sure it's legit
i always just figured because ctrl-c was copy and the others were next to it .
jesus . this makes me realize just how much rape is going on in africa
never go full anal .
not a great selling point in sexual education . gotta scare them before you tell them its okay .
so for only $ . <NUM> each , every single baby born on that continent is getting it ... right ? right ? because we spend like $ <NUM> to
you can see why it spread so fast in the gay community .
nonono . always go full anal . never go full retard .
well ... more like poor health care , poor health education , malnutrition , aversion to the use of condoms , polygamous relationships , denial , aids babies , social
according to an old loveline episode i recently listened to , swallowing semen is the only legitimate typical way to transmit during oral sex .
like pink , sterile bunnies
your intestines are there to transfer nutrients directly into the bloodstream ... imagine if instead of nutrients it was hiv filled semen
and this is unprotected sex ?
not . even . once .
why don't you take a sida over there .
for a long time there were no definite cases of hiv transmitted through vaginal intercourse . there are still no cases of it happening through oral sex . though this
certain regions in africa have <NUM> % of the people infected . imagine what goes on there .
probably was but then someone invented some bullshit backronym .
yes , it's true . if it wasn't , aids would have been way more widespread .
i agree , just don't do it !
drunk , pants around your ankles , a hot chick blowing you ... you would . it's men <NUM> .
i would . live dangerously
<NUM> % : the male partner is infected , along with four other men who happen to be in the blast radius .
i'm glad i found out , now i can have lots and lots of se - oh right .
plus in places they can't afford condoms they have to use the ' rear entrance '
but if both partners have open sores then the rates are a lot higher . herpes is rempant in africa , and therefore so is aids
if you're a fan , you might enjoy this site : i haved listened to far too many of these on my ipod .
don't fall for it . he's trying to infect you !
any progress in the hiv " cure " found a month ago ?
either they're sharing the love , as it were , or these are some pretty epic orgasms we're talking about here .
seriously , i've been misled my entire life .
actually knowing this is sex ed . it's not a good selling point for condoms , if you ask me .
that and by taking women out of the equation - sex becomes a million times easier to acquire . i envy my gay friends .
it's the dry , rough , unlubricated butt sex you gotta be wary of .
i was raised in a moderate , religiously-ambivalent household and went to a pretty liberal schools . prior to last year , i thought it was at least <NUM><NUM> %
welcome to the world of aids .
and being circumcised reduces the risk by ~ <NUM>/<NUM> s ! that's a nice consolation .
the wonderful world of aids *
do you have to pay that yourself ? always wondered how your insurance policies handle pregnancy ...
yes , but insurance companies aren't too keen on people having taken hiv medication in the past , mostly because the vast majority of people who have taken such medication
it's not as wonderful as the brochures made it sound , but i have a medical marijuana prescription now , so it all evens out .
when i was in sex-ed class , my teacher touched his finger to his palm to indicate the size of the hiv virus in comparison to the microscopic holes in
bullshit . the stomach acids will likely destroy the hiv particles in the semen . it's more dangerous to spit .
what is low country ?
how long would it take for them to be destroyed ? there's a lot of room between instantly and eventually . anyway , i don't expect you to take my
dey eat da poo-poo .
i asked my teacher in sex-ed , and he too believed that it was at least above <NUM> % .
the table was curiously missing how many turds you have to eat to have a good shot at getting hiv .
probably anal intercourse . but the article says the risk of transmission recieving anal is still only <NUM> %
nice try . i'm still not gonna have sex with you .
preposterous ! who's had sex <NUM> times .
... but they don't do that either .
apparently that's still pretty goddamn high .
i too thought it was a given .
yeah , because straight people never have anal sex or anything like that .
i have , it didn't work ! also , i take it back - who i more envy is * bi * people . i mean wow , if i
why would it be more dangerous to spit , if that also removed the semen from your system ?
or just how much blood is involved in the rapes ...
shouldve been more specific , as in , from saliva and receiving . not from giving with open sores in mouth or receiving after a circumcision from a vampire .
isn't that risk high enough ?
fuck everything about that . also , i now understand why they favor home births sometimes .
that just sounds pretty unpleasant for both parties
but it's okay because they are born free from socialism right ?
i went to a state school in australia and go to a highly reputable university and assumed it was like <NUM> % . we even had quite liberal sex and

you say it like you've had dozens of the infected lined up at your door , spread eagle .
i'd think that it'd be far more likely if you had any cuts or ulcers in your mouth . than your stomach .
interesting article sort of related to the subject .
what is their motto ? " dry sex : making intercourse as close as possible to masturbation " ?
lol what a load of non sense on wikipedia . haha that made me laugh , resembles scissors . :D
what is the difference between receptive penile-vaginal intercourse and insertive penile-vaginal intercourse . whether you are giving or receiving ?
the anus doesn't transmit anything . what does cause an infection are the micro-bruises that occur , through which the virus comes into the bloodstream .
that's something like <NUM>x higher for men .
depends on the person and the point in the ovulation cycle . some women are incredibly fertile .
the butt is a really good transmission area for hiv . and yes , i totally felt like i was lied to when i realized just how hard it was
i don't know . that's why , when challenged , i corrected myself . i think it made sense to me because swallowing something completely when it's at the back

probably best to keep scaring them - there are still the traditional sexually transmitted diseases to worry about : herpes , syphilis , gonorrhea , chlamydia , and children .
you just didn't find the right guy :D :D
i believe that's true for lambskin condoms .
with vaginal sex , the female has a higher chance of contracting hiv . however , anal sex has overall a distinctly higher chance of infection . how was aids
is it that bad though ? i mean , it's inaccurate to think that you will get hiv after intercourse with an hiv infected person , but is that a
i'd have to have sex with this person every day for <NUM> years before it became more likely than not i became infected . i might take it .
my thought process was " i want to copy it , but i also wanna x it out . ctrl + x ! " bam !
nope , but the same thing was recently posted
that's the last time i have receptive penile-vaginal intercourse . insertive is only half as risky and sounds way sexier to your aids-ridden partner .
ah , i get it . thanks very much !
oral transmission rate are pretty low though . there would have to be cuts / micro-abrasions in both the mouth of the baby and nipple of the mother .
placenta is a hell of a barrier .
no . you're thinking of the chances of getting it from putting the wee wee where the doo doo comes out . that particular sexual deviance is by far the
hundred of millions of dollars per year doesn't seem like that much in the grand scope of things .
i used to live in an area that was double that . it's pretty rough .

so true , i've never done it more than <NUM> times a day .
it is a very good selling point , since you can multiply the probabilities of condom failure with infection rate under failure and get to a chance that is lower

yes , but only the same proportion is still attractive , and only a small increment more would actually sleep with you .
well , if you have unprotected sex with an infected lady a <NUM> times your chances are <NUM> % to get hiv .
i thought it was <NUM> in <NUM> , not <NUM> in <NUM> . maybe what i was told was something like the mean between anal and vaginal intercurse . but
close enough for government propaganda to do the rest .
if you don't make assumptions at all and just have sex whenever i think it's between <NUM> and <NUM> % . if both people are healthy .

anyone know if these odds are for piv or for piv + internal ejaculation ? as i understood it , for women the odds of catching any sti are increased
time for an another unprotected orgy !
yeah , from my lay perspective , that seems like a more likely route too . who knows , maybe i misheard him .
yeah well , it doesn't . just because the likelyhood is that number doesn't mean a person can't infect more often . there are several factors that affect infection chance

i thought it was more like <NUM> % , i am actually kind of surprised so many people thought transmission was virtually guaranteed .
it's bad when you're made to * fear * sex .
there is one important variable that this does not take into effect - viral load . viral load can have a range of several orders of magnitude .
that totally depends on the actual numbers hiv-status of the infected partner . if they are really sick or newly infected they have a much higher chance of transmission .
looks like you've pitched a tent already ...

south park was right - - rich people get less aids !

ive had sex with your wife more than a thousand times . really should have told you sooner , but it seemed easier not to .
that's why i always wear a condom while juggling chain saws in heavy traffic .
that was my thought too ... surprise sex vs consentual sex

true quote from one of my medical school professors regarding this exact topic : " the popular belief is that the risk of transmitting hiv is much higher , so

... and we're worried about this because ? has there been a wave of legislative stabbings lately that i'm not aware of ?
the question becomes where do you draw the line ?
sure . people should also be allowed to carry swiss army knives in the legislature , because they pose no credible threat .
just because they call it a ceremonial dagger doesn't change the fact that they are still daggers . daggers are weapons and weapons are not allowed in the legislature .
one is a blade with a sharp point made of metal with a handle for ease use , the other is plastic or wood tipped with graphite or metal and
how much have you read up on it ? it seems pretty reasonable :
i think a logical solution would be to have decorative kirpans that are a sheath and handle , and no actual blade . the symbolism remains in tact and the
in the supreme court case ruling , banning a kirpan is likened to banning scissors .
that is literally one of maybe <NUM> times it has ever happened in canada . not to mention this example is irrelevant to the " controversy " since it happened
anything you can swing is a ' weapon ' . if you want to get into how they perceive it , the kirpan is intended soley for resisting violence ,
knives are particularly effective at causing bodily harm , and their only purpose in the legislature * would * be to commit assault . there's no pragmatic purpose . it's

i sort of thought the definition of an honour killing was fairly distinct from a domestic murder . i realize it easily polarizes people against the cultures these murders arise

not permitting weapons inside a legislature is not rejecting multiculturalism . it is exercising common sense .
why should it have to be be non-functional ? the kirpan is certainly functional as a weapon .
the logic that anything can be a weapon , so it should all be legal .
the kirpan is symbolic and is about as sharp as a butter knife . i'm fairly certain that a simple test of the blade could be the done at the

the irony is that nowadays , hand drawn animation is expensive and computer-generated animation is cheap .
disney is too busy making lion king <NUM> and snow white deluxe <NUM>d blu-ray special limited edition .
the vacuum running over his own cord and almost blowing up scared the hell out of me . i never ever run over the cord , even now .
and then disney bought his company . worked out pretty well indeed ... except that disney now owns pixar . i'm not too fond of that part :(
nope . movie was distributed by walt disney . i guess they just didn't like lasseter ...
here's a download link to the whole soundtrack . it's pretty much amazing .
disney owns pixar , but if you look at all their movies you can see that pixar actually owns disney
notsomuch in the <NUM> ' s . they were too busy making duck tales ... and dammit , it was awesome ! you shoulda been there .
does anyone not like pixar ? i'm actually curious if there is anyone out there who doesn't and why .
given that it only ever ran on a few screens theatrically , very little . it was effectively direct-to-video , and did very well in that format .
fuck that movie , it was so goddamn disturbing .
i don't think it was the idea that got him fired , they made the movie but it mostly sounds like they were pissed at the idea of a gigantic
i went to wikipedia to find out who's the composer and was pretty unsurpried to find it was a newman .
the only disney sequel i have ever deemed as being good , well in fact , better than the original , imo , is the rescuers down-under
disney are very strange about releasing their films for sale . they do it every now and then . they'll sell lion king , then for <NUM> months ask all
seriously , i feel like this movie made me a bit of a hoarder in my youth . how could i throw away my old radio if it loved me
dvd is available on netflix , so i would imagine you could buy it somewhere . in fact , here's the amazon.com listing :
whenever you want a movie on dvd , just do a search of its title + dvd . that usually finds a dvd copy of it . as for blu-ray
dude ... lion king <NUM> <NUM>/<NUM> please .
invoked some of the strongest emotions i knew i had at that age . i don't think any disney film came close , unless you consider pixar disney , but
lasseter is a great guy . i was in the same classes as one of his sons during middle school . they were super involved in the school , and
they should make a movie where the hero gets separated from what he's used to , then , through the help of a ragtag group of misfits , learns to
talking to one of my teacher who worked for disney , dream works and a few other animation companies . his experience in working with disney was not a good
that movie had some depressed ass writers .
i agree . the plot of toy story <NUM> is scene for scene brave little toaster .
i've never seen this film . it actually looks pretty good .
the aladdin sequels were alright too , but i can't remember if they were straight-to-video .
i saw this movie on lsd . i'm not joking . changed my life .
truth . that's when they brought back robin williams as the genie .
til lesseter drew the bsd daemon ?
the disney renaissance was a beautiful time to be a kid . especially for the transition from disney to pixar , it happened right when we were growing up .
person , all five of your mentioned movies had absolutely no involvement from john lasseter , so your intended point is moot .
til my great uncle fired john lasseter .
i don't know what you're trying to say . are you trying to say something ? edit : ah , lasseter-produced films that have been less than perfect . they
" waking sleeping beauty " is another good doc about the late <NUM>s , early <NUM>s renaissance of disney hand drawn animation , just before the birth of pixar .
how did you get in the vault ? ? they lock their movies up so you can't even buy them !
what about the toy stories ? each one of them was good .
i'd just like to add : i see you're an animator or someone working directly in the field . what do you dislike about the guy ?
yeah he did a comic called the courtyard in <NUM> and now has a follow up . the new series is very well done but it is not a pleasant
haha , this . ^ ^ ^ every time i vacuum .
... oh okay , nevermind then ...
he was executive producer for bolt , princess and the frog & tangled ... and was very instrumental in reigniting traditional animation at disney .
that only cost them ~ <NUM> billion .
the third one was great , it had robin williams back as the genie and aladdin's father sounded like sean connery .
i mostly remember the hilarious voice ad-libbing . there's one point where john lovitz says " we're trapped here like rats ! small little rats with no hair and one
i agree . they need to go back to pre-lasseter quality films like snow white <NUM> - even whiter , and beauty and the beast <NUM> - little beasts doing
any story can be summed up like that . all you have to do is ignore the significant parts . its the details , the emotions that make those stories
from what i gather , " executive producer " is basically a throw-in credit , is it not ? reigniting traditional animation at probably the largest animation studio in the
this is why i always tell my friends that disney didn't buy pixar . pixar bought disney , for - $ <NUM> b .
thanks for that link . it was an interesting read .
til he was also brutally murdered .
scarred for life so many forks ...
oh . i missed that . * shame * it seems , also , like you're trying to say those movies were some variation of ' bad ' . i
upvote for comment and username
relative to the law of the land , your comment is in is fairy tale land too then ; because the supreme court has ruled contrary to your belief .
here's to hoping cars land goes well since john lasseter is now " principal creative advisor " for the wd parks .
so it's like saying thank you to disney for that awesome spiderman comic .
plus ! he's from the lowest social class while his love interest is in the highest ! and guess what ! she can kick ass too !
some friends of ours got us this as a housewarming present . i don't think i'd ever seen it as a kid , but as an adult this movie is
in a deal , mind you , that gave steve jobs controlling share of disney and put john lasseter in charge of many creative development aspects of disney .
he then went on to be a detective for the santa barbra police department .
kinda like how next bought apple for - $ <NUM> million and a couple million shares of stock . seriously , how many other acquired companies end up replacing so

please update if you do .
i'll sum it up . scientology is a cult and fucks up people's lives .
is how you can access wikileaks . i am trying to find how to search through their database . edit : there is a . <NUM>z file on there and
most helpful / relevant response here .
will do , if i can find the scientology ones i'll dump them somewhere and post it here . alternatively , if i can find somewhere they're already hosted ,
use a vpn if you're going to d / l scientology torrents . i can't emphasize this enough .
what do you know ? & #<NUM> ;\ _ & #<NUM> ;
it would appear to be the steve jobs way . taking over companies by getting bought out by them .
i guess aside from throwing small rodents into the sea , disney * does * make a mistake now and again .
warning added . the thing is , this link is on their * * front page * * . this is the only way i could make it even more
google " tom cruise missile " also see : the back story is either on that thread or elsewhere in that forum .
is this irony ? i'm sure this is irony .
and i'll expand on that with a cheeky self-link to my own site about * why * people call scientology a bad cult .
^ i attest to this
i've read the docs and they really aren't very interesting . it's pretty dull and doesn't really contain anything of note that you couldn't already find on that wikipedia page
so the source is a forum post ? forgive me if i'm not overly impressed . anything more reputable ?
was that rhetoric ? i'm sure that was rhetoric .
i would , but if you read them , your head would explode . sorry .

umm , most of the disney movies are re-writes of old stories .
natural curiosity .. i'm not trying to convert or debunk anything ; i just like secrets .
how many times must this be on reddit . i have no problem with most reposts but this is literally on reddit every other week .
it looks like some ideas have some similarity and / or were borrowed . so ? that is how stories work .
well yeah , but now we're getting into the idea that there are only <NUM> stories to be told . man vs man man vs nature man vs science man

my favourite conflict is boy vs . hyper-intelligent ape .
wow , i remember telling people about this tv show back when the lion king came out . no one believed me . i remember watching it before leaving for
wow , same i thought i was the only one .
i always thought this was very , very common knowledge .
it's all about stealing from the greats .
that's a good one .
i found this interesting .
seriously . shooting that scene was scary .
and lion king <NUM> is romeo and juliet
not much to say on the topic , but i do want to say kimba rocks . and im fine with anything that wants to copy it .

" notably the replacement of pre-decimal with decimal money . " wtf ?
how is describing the oompa loompas as skinny , black and pygmy racist ?
yeah , but most of them don't pretend to be an original story
if only there were some way of finding out what that meant
sshhh , don't scare away the fish ...
i've seen willy wonka and the chocolate factory countless times , and just realized that i do not remember seeing a single black person throughout the entire film !
if i remember correctly my friend's aunt wrote the lion king . i'll double-check and report back as to her opinion on this
seems like the best way to do it .
yeah that caught my eye too , because i never understood the joke .
the nostalgia critic has a great review of this .
yeah remember reading this in an interview with him ages ago , pretty nuts ! the four tops that sing " i'll be there " were also suppose to be
yes , but how is that racist ?
why was a flight from london to new york flying over scotland ? is that a normal flight path ?
johnny rotten * should * have died in <NUM> .

what about mickey mouse and santa ?
saying " should have " makes you seem omniscient .

don't worry about it , not everyone is subscribed to til either . some people don't seem to get that there is no common experience , on reddit or anywhere
i want to meet the person who made that " warriors of the wind " cover art . mostly so i can kick them in the face .
this is just * too * relatable .
really hits the target audience
yep , and some animals can clone a lot more than you think . and more animals than you think can change sex .
totally not the most interesting part of that article . thanks for sending me on an hour-long wikipedia spree ...
they're called hijras . i read a good book about them , called " neither man nor woman . " highly recommend .
there was a really interesting history of the studio on the nausicaä dvd , going from ~ <NUM> up to ~ <NUM> . it's definitely worth a watch if you
you should read this book . it talks about this and about animal sexuality , very interesting .
just like the voice actors , he might well have not known at all about the anime .

best red button in a while and that's saying something .
was just watching that movie tonight . :) how can a futurama reference get a downvote ? i ask you fuckin how ? !
the message is , " get the fuck over it and move on . "
warriors of the wind isn't that bad of a movie even . they just took an excellent film and downgraded it to decent . that cover is wildly unrelated though
i believe some native american tribes had a similar concept .

is that turtle on the moon ?
smbc has a button ? huh .
dude , he's trying . it's pretty tough when your basic anatomy renders you incapable of moving if you find yourself on your back .
bottom left of the comic . hover over the red button to see an added bonus :)
didn't notice it before either . it's on the left side under the comic . now i have to read all comics again to check the buttons .
i wouldn't brag about tampa's <NUM> super bowl if we won it thanks to ref mistakes .
i was thrilled when we cut him from the team .
dick move , dude .
wait .. i don't get this . is the guy supposed to be the turtle , and therefore a pussy ? but it is not like he has done shit
that hits way too close to home right now ...
i was thinking " if you make cuts , we're going to make cuts with this " .
this changes everything ! it's like discovering the xkcd alt-text all over again .
xkcd has alt text ? huh .
thank you for sparing me .
just be lazy and hold the mouse over the comic while you read

that's <NUM> , <NUM> billions , all right .
you could assign an ipv <NUM> address to each permutation , and still have <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> addresses remaining .
there's also a pretty excellent episode of ' this american life ' on the subject .
that's * * billions of billions * * !
<NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM> <NUM>
it's probably because people have * zero * conception of <NUM> quintillion : there's nothing to compare it to .
the nauru have not forgotten .
you are a retard .
well there population grew by <NUM> % in <NUM> years . hmmm . <NUM> billion in fund / <NUM> people = $ <NUM> . gdp of <NUM> million . interesting
... that's what we have <NUM> and <NUM> quintillion for .
nauruan . great trivia question , what's the only palendromic nationality .
it's still billions in british counting : forty-three million , two hundred and fifty two thousand and three billion , two hundred and seventy-four thousand , four hundred and eighty
this is about people being treated differently because of their religion . it's not about " us " vs " them " , it's about people like you deciding that
you could assign a hydrogen atom to each permutation , and still have <NUM> × <NUM> ^ <NUM> atoms remaining .
you guys don't go any higher than billion ? so you'd have a billion billion instead of a quadrillion ?
i knew nauru sounded familiar .
how do you even say the word that that number is ? quintillion ? forty-three quintillion , two hunder fifty-two quadrillion , three trillion , two hundred seventy-four billion ,
we do but it goes like this : <NUM> thousand thousands = <NUM> million <NUM> million millions = <NUM> billion <NUM> billion billions = <NUM> trillion <NUM> trillion trillions =
good health , long life .
i think that if you spread them out on the table and shuffle like that for a minute , that's pretty random . also , when you have played some
they had a segment on nightline a couple weeks ago . they said when nauru got rich , it imported the fatty western diet . and now it's the fattest
i can solve any one of those combinations in under a minute .
are nauru-vians all children ?
i do know that after the <NUM>th shuffle the deck starts to go back closer to how it was . the optimal number of times to shuffle a standard deck
<NUM> . i agree . <NUM> . i have no idea .
i bet i can solve <NUM> of those combinations in under a minute .
by " proven " do you mean they tried all of them ?
knowledge of latin roots , fuck yeah .
math ! how does it work ! ?
assuming it's a <NUM> - card deck , there's <NUM> * <NUM> ^ <NUM> , or about <NUM> unvigintillion , or <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM> , <NUM>
are you only counting <NUM>x<NUM>x<NUM> ' s ?
i'm guessing ... some advanced permutation group theory .
tell that to people in zimbabwe .
you could assign a permutation to each day of the year , and still have over <NUM> quintillion permutations left
i bet i could eat <NUM> combinations
how is it hilarious at all ?
it was never advertised as having nearly billions of permutations . it always said <NUM> quintillion .
you could assign a permutation to each of paris hilton's brain cells , and still have over <NUM> quintillion permutations left
also the mass of <NUM> litre of water is <NUM> kilogram
i can give up and throw away the rubiks cube in under a minute .
aha , now that you've explained it to me in the most complicated way possible , i understand it .
why wouldn't it be pentillion ?

the prefix pent - is greek not latin .
i have no business even being here .
i think that comment was meant for rro <NUM> , unless i misunderstand what you mean .
dude , same . my record is <NUM> seconds . i average <NUM><NUM> seconds though because i haven't practiced in awhile .
i remember google brute forcing the solution , so i don't think it was mathematically proved .
and still , every rubik cube with every possible mixed colors , can always be solved in <NUM> or less steps . there's some mathematical proof to that somewhere ...
it was a combination of mathematical efforts to reduce the search space + actual brute force . and proof by exhaustion is still a proof :-)
hmm , how does one calculate that ?
my ex boyfriend and his family are nauruan ... sadly , it's the combination of poor choices in government who squandered the wealth that the tiny island had made for
easter island - the sequel
thanks ! that's a handy simulator .
if you shuffle perfectly . which no one does .
so where are the sith ?
i didn't even know leonardo dicaprio could sing .

that's one way to get around a peadophile problem ...
it is funny either way .
unless the op counted sith as jedi . kind of likes fishes and fish .
correction : there are <NUM> people that wrote " jedi " on their census form .
apparently nauru house has more floor space than the country of nauru itself .
go on then , explain yourself--don't be shy .
what was most interesting about that was finding out that " dude " has a long and winding history , including having once stood for what we might now call
i always forget the word for undecillion , but i just more onto dudecillion and continue on .
agreed . downboat for misrepresenting the article .
who do you think influenced italian law ?

" bob " hilliard got robbed .
you should have seen them travel by rail together . nothing is as lovely as chi chi the chow chow on a choo choo .
you can't count sith as jedi . the sith are like a different species . all i'm sayin ' is that you don't say jedis . that would be grammatically

patriots / colts / steelers have been true dynasties this decade ; no other teams can compare
thank you . that was very helpful .
yeah , and steelers fans erroniously wonder why all of america is rooting for the packers .
can't really call colts a dynasty , when they only won one title .

neither smell , sight or sound from someone vomiting make me nauseas . interesting nonetheless .
they're the atlanta braves of the nfl .
til cannabis can be used as a treatment for nausea - it also shows up on wikipedia's list of antiemetics
yes ! one out of four ! ! !
there is many philogenetic caracteristic which are not present in all the member of a specie , even if they are good . this caracteristic is not absolutely mandatory for
nauseous . you've been ticketed by the spelling police .
because if they all eat something poisonous , those who didn't vomit will die .
well , back in our hunter / gatherer days i could see us using this defense mechanism . everyone has to remember , we've only been domesticated animals for roughly
also an evolved trait : spelling .
nope , that honor would actually go to the raiders .
they are nauseous , you become nauseated .
first thing i though of
you mean it makes you nauseated ?
in the eighties , early <NUM> ' s it was the exact opposite . cowboys / <NUM>ers / giants
this reminds me of those skits they used to have on snl where everyone had hoses run up their sleeves so they could throw up gallons of corn chowder .
as a patriots fan , i love it when other fans hate my team . it means you a re relevant and they hate you because you are good .
for me it was desensitization . then i stopped working in childcare and at the homeless shelter and i got it back .
as a lions fan i fucking hate this subreddit ...
it's ok , we all love you !
careful there , spelly-the-stone-thrower .
i wouldn't dismiss the idea of it in earlier species but i've never came across it in people . the sight of someone vomiting can sometimes make me gag but
no it isn't . it can't be .
visited dachau in <NUM> . although not an extermination camp , you can still see the ovens and gas house , an execution area for the special prisoners and more

cabs are going to make a bunch on the route this weekend . who likes shuttle buses ?
thanks for the update !
i pity anyone trying to catch a shuttle bus at dundas ..
should also mention here that you might also see ¬ for a negation symbol , and i ’ ve seen ^ and & both used as conjunction symbols .
guess where i'm staying out of this weekend .
don't forget the red button !
they are fairly interchangeable , i've seen ¬ more for discrete math and other comp sci classes while i've seen ~ more in philosophy classes .
or anywhere , really . i have never seen dundas during a shuttle time , is it especially bad for some reason ?
is it just me , or is → a bad example ? i ask because in the event that b is true but a is false , would yield a
if it's anything like the subway , it'll be hell .
to be a bit more clear , it's between bloor and union . also , as an alternate to taking the shuttle bus is using the path .
let's face the facts . analytical philosophy is ... well ... not actually philosophy .
he was * jack ? * no wonder i've always considered this guy one of my more favorite actors .
r / nfl is very civil towards lions fans , and in fact we are anticipating your team's continued improvement in the years to come .
what ? i didn't say it was fallacious , i said it was labeled incorrectly . and i gave and example in the post you're responding to .
it's gon ' rain !
all good then ? all good then . have an upboat .
and you as well sir .
ehhh , i live in malvern and really isn't bad at all , boring as hell sure , influx of tamils here , but hey , it is pretty much
hi . calling modus tollens " proof by contraposition " is wrong , actually . you should know because you are pursuing a master's in logic .
you are correct : " it is modus tollens , not proof by contraposition . " you are correct : " it is wrong , not fallacious . " now
phil lemarr was the best part of the old mad tv .
he was vamp ? ! that dude has talent - i never would have placed him if it wasn't for this list .
man , i don't even have an opinion .
honestly , i love where the lions are headed with all that talent they have . with that said , i have no idea how long its gonna take you
i don't remember axin ' you a goddamn thing
he's hermes from futurama ? and samurai jack ! ? ! sweet deal .
when in doubt , draw a truth table .
wow , phil lamarr is recognized as " that voice actor from my favorite cartoons " . i feel old .
samurai jack talked ? ! ?
does he have an opinion yet ?
correct me if i'm wrong but wasnt he also on madtv for awhile . also i had no idea he was a voice actor . * * edit * *
can it be a jumping high five ? ?
do you see a sign on my front yard that says " dead samurai storage ! ? "
yea , buck is even modeled after him . and the girl is <NUM> from bsg
yeah ... that law has been around for a while . it's pretty lame , if you ask me !
to be honest , you just sign up for it and then completely forget about it . i just hope there is never a cause to remember it
yep . and if they lose your registration information , you will be denied student loans and federal gov't jobs . i found this out the hard way ten years
i had to just to get fafsa loans for college .
i assume you're a female or under <NUM> . because every legal age male knows this .
whats strange is that is you join the military and do your <NUM> years and get out , you still have to sign up for it or you may not
it's not really crazy when you consider all someone has to do is fill out a <NUM> minute registration and then forget about it . the draft has been banned
if i recall correctly they just called me some and then signed me up anyways .
if they tried to bring back the draft there would be a shitstorm the likes i can't think of .
also ... they send you a free mach <NUM> razor ! or at least they did back when i did it .
i often wonder why i don't here the women's rights activists protesting that women are not required to do this . equal is equal , except when it's putting your
are you sure ? it seems impossible for americans to get outraged about anything .
not ' banned ' , just not instated . and yeah , to go for a driver's license , register to vote , do college loans , or any other
because the poor people are the ones fighting our wars . trust me , if we started sending people over randomly , there would be outrage .
oh . is that why i got a free razor ?
even back in the days of vietnam , people of privilege found plenty of ways to get out of going into harm's way . combine this with the fact that
if you randomly got a razor in the mail with no info on why and you turned <NUM> within the last year , probably .
pretty sure you must be signed up in order to vote as well .
the least they could have given me was a gun . or big pack of replacement blades at least ! those things are expensive as hell .
i'm pretty sure that there are also some states that won't issue you a driver's license if you have not registered .
one click on fafsa form
i'm not going to go into the whole schpiel unless you're actually interested , but if you hate spending a shit ton of money on cartridge razors , you can
i can confirm this .
many countries have mandatory military service for <NUM><NUM> years for young men out of hs . wikipediaz
i learned that when i turned <NUM> , so happy birthday to you i guess .
well . i turned <NUM> six years ago and received it , too . i probably should have questioned why i received it but hey , i'm not one to
try bringing that up to a rights activist . the results are hilarious .
i've been tempted , but i don't use goop . i shave in the shower with just my razor , shower water , and manliness .
sign up . eat twinkies . eat more twinkies . when the draft is brought back you're too unfit to serve . problem solved .
also , he's private ryan in saving private ryan .
it's not really a con . they just make sure that that's one of the few possibilities available for low-income people to get jobs and education .
* in case war were declared *
wow , that's fucking brilliant . i've been shaving with gillette razors since i turned <NUM> ... i'm now <NUM> .
he was one of the best from season <NUM> . <NUM>nd to david herman . who you may know as michael bolton from office space . he also does a
or , you know , not from the united states .
yeah , i'm <NUM> and i remember getting that razor back when i turned <NUM>
what i said is technically correct - the best kind of correct .
thanks for reminding me to order new blades .
it's very easy to get americans outraged about anything - it's difficult to get them to do something about it , or to remember their outrage a few weeks later
shit , if you wanted to go to college , you could weasel your way out on those grounds .
yeah , but everyone knows that non-americans don't visit reddit . edit : / s
im <NUM> , yeah , off the hook !
that's how they got me , though its ironic because being a student excludes me from the draft .
i'm a non-american and i don't visit .
i turned <NUM> in ' <NUM> , signed up for the ss , and never received a damn thing !
guards ! bring me the forms i need to sign to have them taken away !
what ? she is modeled after <NUM> ? brb
how is this possible ? !
you don't need to sign up for ss to get your license in massachusetts .
shithouse ... just realised . have your upboat and my apology sir .
you can just pull the razor backwards against an old pair of jeans <NUM><NUM> times . it will sharpen them right up .
that has always been the penalty . it's basically there so you don't try to dodge a draft by not registering .
i love how the ss has the same abbreviation as the ss .
my <NUM>th birthday was likewise a huge relief for the same reason .
i am actually going through réddit , where the upvotes are in metric and we're all drunk by lunch . it's a good site .
" if the average twenty-something suddenly could be shipped to iraq or afghanistan , expect opposition to the war to skyrocket . " plus better tunes !
i still feel that it is , because you are taking advantage of those in a difficult economic situation . i'd much rather see the government provide assistance to lower-income
she was referring to the wednesday panel she was part of , not her job in the senate . which she clarified in the next sentence of the article you

they assumed you'd be homeless before you got the razor anyways .
you wanna piss people off , pass a requirement that their daughters have to sign for the draft , and might have to go and die , and not just
til nathan fillion grew up in the same part of edmonton as me , mill woods .
unconstitutional because of gender discrimination . won't happen .
huh ? once you go into the military , you don't have to sign up for selective service . you do remain on inactive reserve , however .
i thought it was common knowledge that most of the odst's in halo <NUM> : odst are actors from firefly ? well <NUM> of them at least .
sure , he did all that work himself .
jets trainer : ' you know that phrase , win or go home ? well son , we didn't win ... '
i find it very difficult to believe he took <NUM> credit hours , and acted and got a <NUM> in one semester without a lot of help .
it's definitely not related to the draft . my sister got one around her <NUM>th birthday . we never figured out why .
and just like gb as soon as people show you cropping quotes you ignore it and try to misdirect . and you people say the conservatives act like americans ?
i really want to make a joke at your sister's expense but i'm afraid you're going to cyber punch me .
this is not the case in my state . however , i did need to sign up in order apply for a learners permit .
i know this is the case in virginia .

i never had much appreciation for the games . but when i learned that odst had three firefly actors and a discontinuous narrative , my heart grew three sizes that

from what i heard , he has assistants take notes for him .
i've been fascinated with him since he started working on a soap opera just for fun even though he's a movie star . the guys confounds me . he may

from what he said , he hardly misses class ...
your no fun league badge seems appropriate when paired with this grumpy " kids these days " comment
i forget where i read it , but he had personal assistants attend classes for him and he only showed up for tests . still impressive , though .
that's a direct quote out of the sun , blame them and stop acting like a jackass .
didn't he get a d in his acting class ?

my dad did <NUM> women for a couple of semesters while at the air force academy . it's not impossible .

i hate it when my rights and constitution are too loose .
<NUM> classes a day ? i doubt it , mostly because schools don't have <NUM> hours worth of regular lecture periods .
jlygrngiant posted that they read someplace that he had assistants attend classes for him . that would explain how he " went " to class .
the common consensus seems to be that he had multiple personal assistants attending class , taking notes , etc . i'm sure it's not hard to work out a deal
i'm trying to do the opposite of that right now ...
<NUM> units of humanities would be easier , but not easy . and by easier , i still mean completely impossible .

i once thought as you did . i knew we'd never let our leaders get away with another vietnam , they'd be booed out of office in a heartbeat .

interesting , though i expect it'll just make for more paperwork . students will just refile their deferment every time they register for classes . if it got bad enough
nope , it's within <NUM> days of your <NUM>th . guess you just never tried to apply to anything with a selective service requirement .
yes you do . if for some reason you didn't when you were <NUM> and now you're on inactive reserve and apply for some va benefit you could be denied

or just stupid , because i'm female and knew this well before age <NUM> .
hi , <NUM> year old female here . i would willingly register for the draft if i weren't medically disqualified . i'm sure i'm not the only one .

i work with the inventor of the arj compression format ... he's currently heating up nasty food in our microwave .
what would you call it ?
i don't really know . i guess i'm used to hearing " alcohol poisoning " , or just " they had to get their stomach pumped " or something ,
are you saying that there is such thing as too much peppermint schnapps ? ?
he was buried in a smaller coffin.zip
what a delicious way to go out .
well , it's not some thing you would normally " dose " so " overdosing " isn't the best choice of words . alcohol poisoning works fine .
i remember something about his home being three feet deep in garbage everywhere - with trails through the garbage .
what's he doing for work these days ?
i guess you could say that alcohol compressed his life .
very sad he didn't rehab .
i remember my father telling me this story when i was younger . i think the moral of it was " in the event that you choose to spend your

haha man mark sanchez is one corny dude . this reminds me of when he said in a postgame interview that at half time he told his teammates we're adults
alcohol overdose and poisoning are often used interchangeably . i feel like overdose should describe how much you drank while poisoning should describe your reaction to it , but usually
if drinking too much peppermint schnapps is wrong ... i don't want to be right .
amen . it's sad to see someone so talented and young succumb to addiction to alcohol or drugs .

yeah , zapp was originally intended for hartman , but he died before production ...

how exactly would you ' bone ' hookers ? aren't you missing a bone ?

i remember i was watching this movie called star kid when i was young . i saw this one guy and i was like ... hey , looks like francis
so his car was registered ?
that's not alcohol poisoning , that's just being to drunk . alchohol poisoning is passed out or in convulsions . i've done what you said hundreds of times , still
i remember one of the obituaries being worded something like ... phillip katz is survived by his mother , at whose kitchen table pkzip was conceived , and his sister
i wondered if they were both hubologists .
also , both their shows had their finale in the same week .
damn , someone should've zipped him into an alcoholics anonymous meeting .
and that they made * laura prepon * a scientologist . unforgivable .
i too like to minze it up . they came out with a couple new flavors . would not recommend shots .
in addition it creates a lot of excess heat which forces the user to wait for it to cool down or risk damage .
a fifth of cheap vodka costs less than a big bottle of listerine . i use to buy something like " flogman's potato vodka " for <NUM> / fifth .

there's a difference between copying ideas , and copying code . a programming textbook gives you ideas ... but you don't copy the code in it to do your assignments
so , ayn rand had more influence on the last generation of power brokers than any other philosopher ? no wonder we're in such dire straits .
as far as we know , reddit won't cause cancer .
that's putting the ape in rape , for sure .
this is the sort of thing that when i read it on wikipedia i am reminded that i cannot blindly accept everything i read on wikipedia ...

just like gasoline is <NUM> % organic , right ? language is frequently illogical .
isn't this how aids started ?

pkzip ! i haven't thought about that tool in years . haven't used it since my bbs days dling back issues of phrack !

i'm not sure where hangovers end and alcohol poisoning begins anymore .
pkzip was the first software purchase i ever made . i was very proud of that floppy disc with a custom label with * my * key .

if you look at the binary content of a zip file it also starts with the ascii codes for pk .

why should they be different from other police forces all over the world . false flag operations are a very important weapon in their arsenal .

i found the question dubious to start with hence the lack of an explanation as to why .
well that's good to know . sorry you lost your job , though !
oh , i had been considering quitting anyway . i didn't feel right taking a paycheck from an entity that shouldn't exist .
oh , wow , that brings back some memories :)
if you find that interesting , read matt taibbi's book griftopia . his chapter on greenspan is called " the biggest asshole in the universe "
she said no , but she meant yes .
well i'm done with the internet for today .
just like ayn rand felt bad about taking public assistance .
aretha franklin doesn't have soul ? i wonder what the mormon dudes were smoking .
i haven't an opinion on that one . on one hand she was taxed and forced to pay into the system , on the other hand it's still a breach

well they don't , and neither do the mormons , or anybody else .
they also believed that you could become white through salvation , if you weren't already .
so uncle ruckus was basically mormon ?
i'm a ginger and immediately thought this . damn you , south park .
also , they've had like <NUM> quarterbacks with bama bangs .
roll tide or crime wave ?
yeah , but , so what , they are still in the sec so it doesn't matter / sarcasm on

could be right . however , usc and north carolina have some of the most severe infractions in the last <NUM> years .
every conference has teams that recruit over their <NUM> limit .
oh , and also , the pulsed laser approach would only work in atmosphere . in vacuum it would be invisible , having no medium to superheat into plasma .

don't forget that we won * and * lost the american civil war , too .

very true . here is your banana . ;-)
plus they burned down the white house and the capital building .
that's like a year younger than she was on that <NUM> ' s show .
i've never been able to understand how canada can win a war <NUM> years before it was confederated by the constitution act .
the americans also burned down york , upper canada though . washington was direct retaliation .
i was always taught that it was just kind of a tie .
sounds like a sore loser
i'm canadian ... but i applaud the response i too would have given .
the people residing within a country are * * the * * country the name is later attached to .
as far as i've learned here in the us , it's a draw . except we got a national anthem out of it . so , us won something .

i grew up hearing about it as a loss , but one that ended up with us being on good terms with britain , so it wasn't so bad .
ya thats right . whos white house got burned to the ground ? yaaaa
it's cool to see established actors when they were younger .
that's why the " white house " is white
i am always reminded of " three dead trolls in a baggie " <NUM>war
she had that smile down , even back then .
i really like this analogy .
do you not agree that if the united states ' invasion was successful , a large part of canada would most likely to be annexed ? as a canadian how
which is especially funny , considering canada didn't exist until <NUM> .
i'll just repost this here : munificent's ghetto guide to big-o .
just look at the kill death ratio , canada won
yeah , but the guy the usa tried to swing at had been giving him dirty looks all night .
yeah , i think macarthur was a bit vociferous about that . at the same time , the china of that time was nothing like the china of today .
thanks for the link . it'll be really helpful .
she was sprayed with urine in krippendorf's tribe .
i see it as so insignificant because ' we ' won and it had no effect on us . you're right , i'm completely biased and i never took into

i think we can all agree that <NUM> has the best overture , though !
funny , i thought war was declared because britain kept kidnapping our citizens and drafting them into their navy .
the more you know ! i was just confused by " provincial capital of canada "
except the guy at the bar minding his own business was actually kidnapping the other guy's children and selling them into slavery in his navy ...
heh , you're right .
now if only they could ever have one of their lists all on one page .
yeah . this is what i miss .
this is a reply in which i use an onomatopoeic word for the sound of an object rushing past a person's head .
