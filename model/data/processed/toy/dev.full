EOS don't forget that the purpose of an endowment is to support the mission of the institution in perpetuity . that means that the endowment has to support the school even when there are downturns in the market and those gains have to outpace both the spending rate ( the percentage of the endowment spent each year ) + inflation . harvard's fund managers generally do a good job at this , but they do miss from time to time . although harvard and other private colleges can hardly be compared , most try to stay at a spent rate of about 4 % to 5 % as a matter of typical operations . some spend more ; some spend less . it's a matter of risk tolerance and operational need ( some colleges spend way more because they don't get sufficient tuition income to fully cover operations and therefore have excess endowment draws ) . a 4 % spend rate on a $ 35b endowment equates to a $ 1.4 b draw . the draw , as mentioned , covers student financial aid / scholarships , and a whole host of other purposes . it's also really important to note that most endowments have , at a minimum , two classes of assets inside them - - restricted and unrestricted - - although there can be more . restricted funds are those that must be used for a donor's stated purpose . unrestricted funds are those that can be used for any purpose deemed fit by the institution . even the gains from someone's restricted donation are themselves restricted . harvard's endowment has a 70 % restricted / 30 % unrestricted mix . so , theoretically , it could be that harvard's entire restricted endowment is limited to being spent on supporting a single building and nothing else . if that were the case ( which it's not ... just using it for illustrative purposes ) , then only 30 % of the endowment would be able to be used for scholarships and other institutional support . back to that $ 1.4 b spend rate now ... at 22,000 students , that comes out to $ 63,636 . 36 per student . that's not a ton of money . yes ... in real terms , it's a lot of money , but given all of the other things that need to be supported , it doesn't go very far . the college has to support a ton of expenses , including financial aid / scholarships ( by far , the biggest expense or one of the biggest expenses at a private college ) , faculty and staff salaries , physical plant support ( harvard spends a huge amount of money on supporting buildings - - remember , every building has ongoing maintenance needs ) and other activities . i hope that this puts that " huge endowment " into context . yes , it's a lot of money , but it's a lot of money for a reason . edit 1 : read another comment here about spending donated funds . remember - - endowments are intended to support the college in perpetuity . therefore , they need to protect the corpus ( the actual real dollars that were donated plus any investment gains above the spend rate ) so that there are sufficient funds to continue operating forever . some funds are intended to be spent one time , but the vast majority are intended to live forever . edit 2 : another way endowments are used ... let's look at maintenance . you've seen colleges fundraise to build a brand new building , right ? when done right , that fundraising activity covers the cost of the building as well as the cost to maintain that building . this way , the college gets their new building without having to increase tuition to cover one-time construction and ongoing maintenance costs .	22k . i had no idea harvard was so large .

EOS it's been almost 2 decades since my college application process but my harvard app was an interesting process . first step was the paper application and then an interview with a local alum . my application was good but not , by harvard standards , outstanding . 99 + percentile on sat and perfect grades but i hadn't done anything amazing in my life yet . i was just a smart kid from a small town with middle class parents . for the alum interview i was paired with a retiree . he and i got along really well and got to know each other through the process . he talked a lot about how the school seemed to have changed since he graduated ( 50s if i had to guess ) but he was encouraging . one day he called me and asked if i'd gotten my admissions decision yet . i hadn't . he called me the next day and he was pissed off . really pissed off . apparently he'd been talking to the admissions office and didn't like the answers he was getting . what i gathered was that i was one of those kids that would have fallen into the ' generous financial aid packages ' and they maybe didn't want me if i wasn't going to be paying . the alum just ranted and raved as only wealthy smart old folks who are done giving a shit what people think can . he was so angry at " his school " valuing money over accepting the best applicants . i know i wasn't the best , not by a long shot , but i got his point . things went back and forth a few times with my only communication being through my alumni interviewer . i ended up getting the rejection letter way late in the admission cycle . took a full ride plus stipend elsewhere and no regrets but the whole thing left a bitter taste in my mouth for a while . ended up working with quite a few harvard folks after law school and honestly the whole ' oh you went to haaaarvard ? i did as well . what house were you in ? ' or whatever is really annoying so i'm pleased i dodged it . now , being an awkward 17 year old and aggressively hitting on the 20 something alumni interviewer from duke , that one i sorta regret ... edits : the duke story : a combination of nerves and awkwardness led to me basically creeping on this girl during the interview . did not work out . i immediately felt bad for her and continue to do so . i was a stupid awkward kid . i got better . don't believe me ? i dunno , man . maybe alumni wasn't telling the truth . maybe i filled in the couple small missing portions of the story incorrectly . maybe i just didn't get in . none of these would surprise me but when everyone is saying it's all need blind i wanted to tell my story . i do think admissions processes have changed . need blind was , by my memory , in its infancy in the late 90s . the you went to haaaaarvard thing ? intended as gentle ribbing . even the two yahoos i talked about in the later comment who tried to play ' ohhh harvard ' in front of very rich lawyers and bankers would likely face palm when remembering the story . i've got lots of friends that went to prestigious schools . lots that went to garbage schools . lots that didn't go to school . i've got friends that are filthy rich and dirt poor . i'm at the point in my life where in career you're judged by your ability to excel in the job . in personal life it's about people whose company i enjoy .	how are the bitches now ?

EOS yes , but it's a bit more complicated with supermassive black holes . an astronaut could theoretically survive past the event horizon ( point of no return ) , still alive while falling toward the centre , but as you say , will eventually die of tidal forces getting too powerful . in other words : you die well _before_ entering a 10 - solar-massed black hole , but you die well _after_ entering a 100,000- solar-massed black hole . in theory , you could live out the rest of your natural life inside of a sufficiently sized black hole , falling toward the centre all the while . e : fucked up terms	given time dilation effects for these rapidly spinning super massive black holes , it's possible that the rest of your life is remarkably close to the rest of the universe's life too .

EOS not officially . at best it was an overly casual nickname . especially later on many nazis didn't have a problem with the term informally , but it would never have been used for anything official . actually as a german i often find it slightly jarring how the term is used in serious contexts in english . to me " nazi germany " is about on par with " commie russia " in terms of formality .	at no point did i suggest it was an official title .

EOS edit : goddamn , yall need to stop upvoting me so much or else i'm gonna finally write that megapost about why every single actor in harry potter is miscast except alan rickman . - - - while i don't want to rain on anybody's party , i think edit-the-hobbit efforts are doomed to failure . if you look at [ * * what plot threads actually constitute the films , like in this chart i made a few years ago * * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/W3xeaOf.png ) there are two basic flaws with em . 1 . there's a ton of material ( everything in color in the chart ) that was simply invented and shoved in ( for reasons explained by / u / beregond 23 ' s post , i am 100 % sympathetic about how terrible most of these scenes turned out . pj gets way too much blame for this , he was making up the story on set practically ) . 2 . the movies substitute an * * aragorn story * * for a * * bilbo story * * . but there is no aragorn in hobbit , you say ? yes there is , he's just not * called * aragorn ... he's called thorin oakenshield . the first flaw is fixable ... if you don't like tauriel or dul guldur you can just cut those elements pretty cleanly out of the film . but the second flaw is not fixable . bilbo is reduced to a side character in his own trilogy and thorin is turned into the main character . here's something that's kind of a joke , but makes a point too . * * " the hobbit " bechdel test : when two random characters are talking , who do they talk about ? * * when smaug and bilbo are talking , smaug talks about how thorin's quest will fail ( a line invented by pj ) . when evangeline lilly and dwarf number whatever are talking by themselves , to each other ... they talk about thorin . the second movie opens with an added flashback scene that exists only to remind us this is all about thorin's king-destiny . the third movie makes the entire battle climax in a duel between thorin and orc whoever . it's thorin's story . what's worse is that bilbo's scenes are * * robbed of their story importance by the adaptation so you can't even make a " just bilbo " film . * * when you think about adapting bilbo's story arc - like what scenes would you pick to audition and cast bilbo ? - you probably think of : - bilbo being a timid host at his own unexpected party - bilbo riddling with gollum - bilbo taunting the spiders and saving the dwarves - bilbo sneaking the dwarves to laketown in barrels - bilbo's verbal duel with smaug - bilbo giving up the arkenstone - bilbo's final conversation with thorin i think the first two scenes on this list were done appropriately and well . also martin freeman is fun in the role . but all the rest of these scenes were adapted abysmally badly . like " yeah ... you missed the point of the story " badly . in each beat of the story , bilbo is growing in knowhow , courage and gumption . he increasingly leads the dwarves , who are static characters . yet in the movies , each one of these scenes has bilbo being completely * * upstaged * * by a cast of charismatic action-movie ninja dwarves , * plus * fucking * legolas * , * plus * a girl legolas . bilbo just becomes indistinguishable backup dwarf . if the entire cast is action heroes why is bilbo needed ? pj was so worried about making the dwarves distinguishable and interesting characters . remember their goofy haircuts ? he should have asked himself - why does * tolkien * take us on an adventure with these 14 characters and apart from gandalf , bilbo , thorin and * mmmmmmaybe * bombur the reader doesn't get any sense of their personalities at all ? because that's superfluous to the story . the other problem with these movies is how violent they are . now don't get me wrong - there's already too much arguing on the internet about the hobbit being " a children's book " whatever that means . what i mean is something different . look back at that list of key bilbo scenes . how many problems does bilbo resolve with violence ? * * oh wait ... is it ~ ~ none ~ ~ ? * * ( edit : [ thanks for the poster who reminded me ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/5pf4pw/til_that_due_to_budget_issues_the_lord_of_the/dcr4iwi/ ) he does kill a bunch of spiders . kind of weakens my point . however , the other scenarios / problems are solved nonviolently . ) this is like a key storytelling point of the hobbit . bilbo isn't the biggest or strongest character but he's the one who sees the solution before all the dwarves . the guy who was dragged along just to be their " burglar " instead becomes very much their leader and guide in gandalf's absence . the truth is that after doing lotr peter jackson was * * * afraid * * * to do a movie that didn't meet those expectations . for instance , a movie where the protagonist solves most of the problems by his wits . it would be like making an indiana jones sequel about indy's son mutt except mutt doesn't shoot any nazis , or kiss any ladies or even drive a tank . what kind of indy story is that ? well it's * not * an indy story , it's a mutt story . but if it has indy branding it has to be an indy story or else audiences will say it's a ripoff . i have no doubt that this central paradox is why the hobbit was plagued with preproduction problems . it's just a central conflict between adapting the movie as itself , or adapting it as " another volume of lotr " which was the eventual direction . this is what forced pj to shove in more gandalf , more legolas , more orcs , and even attempted to bring back viggo before the actor wisely shut him down . it's also why the bo5a is the central focus of the third movie ... a faithful adaptation would probably omit it just like tolkien did . the storytelling purpose of the battle is that it's an avoidable tragedy that ends thorin's life , but not before he admits how wise bilbo has become . bilbo plays no role in the battle itself , he doesn't even witness the battle , and its main protagonists ( except thorin & gandalf ) and the consequences of the battle ( except thorin's death ) are enormously beyond the scope of bilbo's perspective and the resolution of his story arc . but the most important reason that bo5a stunk from beginning to end is that it was a faked climax . the hobbit is a story of escalating episodes . each of them is disconnected more or less from the others . that is , the spiders , the wargs , gollum and smaug aren't in league against team bilbo . they're not all controlled by a mastermind orc ( ok yes , they are metaphysically on team sauron by being creatures of darkness , but it's not like sauron is giving them orders ) . the hobbit is a serial adventure story but because the lotr had a doomsday threat and a mastermind , the hobbit has to have one too . because the lotr had a climactic battle against all odds , the hobbit has to have one too . if the battle of five armies had not been in the book , peter would have invented it . - - - edit thanks for the gold . i'll add one final thought here . imo the craziest thing about the hobbit movies is that if you think about them critically you start to realize that the same flaws nearly took down the lotr trilogy . did you guys know that peter jackson originally shot a final showdown battle in return of the king * * * between aragorn and sauron * * * ? i shit you not , it's in the behind the scenes dvd , and the huge cgi troll aragorn fights was originally intended to be a badass walking-around sauron like in the fellowship prologue . it's a fucking miracle that they slapped themselves and said " we better not . " there are a lot of scenes added to lotr where that we better not thinking wasn't strong enough , like the theme park ride pile of skulls in the paths of the dead , or the scene in ttt where aragorn falls off a cliff to have a convo with dream arwen . but imo , the structure of lotr as a book * * * forced * * * peter to tell the story the right way , by splitting the fellowship into two story threads . i think that peter shot the aragorn half of ttt + rotk in a very aragorn-centric way just as a desperate backup in case this weird story of # # # " two homoerotic leprechauns being led through a swamp by a cgi skeleton-man on a quest to throw away magic jewelry " didn't test well with audiences and he had to fall back on telling a more intelligible disney-fantasy story of # # # " a prince and his cool comic-relief sidekicks returning to the prince's kingdom , fighting awesome battles against a demon king and winning a princess's hand . " i mean which of these is the easier movie pitch ? it's not really a contest , huh ? if the entire fellowship had gone to mordor together , i think poor sam might not have even made it into the script . but tolkien gave pj no choice . it was all because tolkien divided the story threads that peter even gave the hobbits a fighting chance . in the new movies everyone's in the same group so peter naturally gravitates towards the aragorniest character .	reading this comment has convinced me to read the hobbit and lotr books .

EOS > i think the first two scenes on this list were done appropriately and well . this is the only thing i strongly disagree with and i refer to how they adapted bilbo as the host in the unexpected party . the whole trick of this party was that bilbo was a cranky , smug , and even rude hobbit towards adventures and dangerous outsiders but gandalf could trick him into being sucked into the quest because as a rule bilbo will not be a bad host . he spends the whole time with the dwarves bumbling around annoyed but unable to really confront them and must must tolerate and cater to them as a good host would . so already his character felt off to me in the film because he was being very truculent and rude openly . i remember the image from the book of bilbo being fluster and exhausted and rather turned upside down sitting down kind of shell shocked once the eating had been done and that image never appeared in the film . instead it was always rather rude and annoyed meaning there's no set up for him being worn down into going along or even being sympathetic to the enterprise . secondly in the book bilbo lost all his impudence the moment the map showed up and that was supposed to be the first sign that his tookishness was going to take over . sadly in the film he didn't really respond to the map at all . this all leads to the issue of why bilbo went along . it literally ended up being in the film that they'd done such a bad job of providing bilbo with a motive for going along , because they're caught up in talking about the aragorn thorin quest , that at the 11th and a half hour gandalf says to bilbo _you must go , you're a took you know ! _ and bilbo says _oh ... well of course i guess i have to ! _ and suddenly out of nowhere this totally irrelevant character trundles along on an adventure he has shown no interest in participating in . it was so crap to me that pretty much knew the film was going to be terrible from there on out . it made no sense either because they didn't really cut anything and spent a long time on that sequence so to not adapt it accurately , and in a necessary manner to give bilbo a bloody character , seemed bizarre . other than that i completely agree with your analysis .	i've always wondered why they thought they knew better than tolkien how to tell one of the best epic stories ever . just tell it how it's in the books , for fuck's sake .

" i mean which of these is the easier movie pitch ? it's not really a contest , huh ? if the entire fellowship had gone to mordor together , i think poor sam might not have even made it into the script . but tolkien gave pj no choice . it was all because tolkien divided the story threads that peter even gave the hobbits a fighting chance . in the new movies everyone's in the same group so peter naturally gravitates towards the aragorniest character . EOS this is a beautiful explanation about how wretched the hobbit movies were . the lotr movies came out when i was in high school and i had read tolkein many times . i saw each of them in the theaters at least five times and then again many times later , but the hobbits i've seen one time each . there is nothing good in any of them , hardly even a good scene .	you know nothing about cinema . there were plenty of good scenes .

EOS the wiki page says gacy showed the investigators and journalists to whom he told this story a scar on his arm that he claimed was from the encounter , which they believed to support his story . gacy claimed he picked a guy up from the bus terminal , took him to see various chicago landmarks , then told the kid he could sleep at his house and gacy would drop him back off at the bus station the next morning . gacy said he awoke the next morning to see the kid , who was something like 15-21 years old , standing at his bedroom door holding a knife . gacy said he bolted up and grabbed at the guy , who raised his hands in a defensive gesture , cutting gacy on the arm and giving him the scar he later showed as proof . gacy said he then slammed the kids head into the wall several times until he fell down , and the kid kicked him in the chest . gacy said he then stabbed the kid in the chest with the knife , killing him . he said he then got up and walked to the kitchen where he saw a table set for 2 , an open egg carton and unsliced bacon on the table . he said he noticed that he had orgasmed while killing the teen , and that this showed him that murder was " the ultimate thrill " . i personally think this story is ludicrous . gacy recruited other victims from bus terminals who he raped and killed . at that time he had already been prosecuted for sexual violence against a young man , so it seems unlikely he would just innocently pick up a young boy from a bus station to sleep at his house just to be nice . i think it's far more likely that gacy made up this story in case he got caught for the first murder , and when he didn't , he just continued killing . the fact that this scar on his arm just happens to be from the first murder he committed , which happened to be an accident , just seems self-serving . it sounds like bad fiction . and its a little coincidental that this first , accidental murder had the exact same mo as other , later , non - " accidental " murders he committed on boys from the same bus terminal . it's just too easy and convenient a story . if you've noticed , in the last 20 years the us has seen an increase in spree killers , like the batman theater shooting and sandy hook , but a decrease in serial killers . by a lot . in the 70s , an american would break the record for most prolific serial killer of all time every few years . and many of those serial killers - gacy , dean corll , jeffrey dahmer - were gay , and sometimes pedophiles . they were killing men who they raped and sexually tortured , often while married to women or at least remaining closeted in their public and social lives . i think some of this decrease has to do with the increased acceptance of homosexuality , in that these men who in the 70s would have had no sexual outlet and would be ashamed or ostracized for being gay , turned to killing as a way to satisfy their sexual urges while keeping their sexuality secret . dahmer famously tried to create " zombie sex slaves " by lobotomizing or otherwise damaging the brains of victims , so he wouldn't have to procure new victims and kill someone every time he had sex . he was a sexual sadist , obviously , but the murder was secondary : he wanted obedient , mindless male sex slaves , and he couldn't find a way to get that without violence and murder , but he did try . and it seems that the repression of homosexuality had something to do with these cases . now , gay men are free to be open and pursue relationships with men without fear of persecution or ostracism , but as recently as the 90s , the prospect of being an openly gay man might have been so unpalatable to some that they instead turned to murder to keep their predilections secret . i'm sure there are other factors at play , but there has been a remarkable decrease in serial killing since the 70s , which for whatever reason included many gay serial killers . maybe the coincident gay rights movement was totally unrelated , but i suspect there was some relationship . i mean , since the 70s , the us went from discovering a new serial killer practically every year , if not more often than that , to having practically no serial killers in the last 20 years that we know of .	so ... when gay people can't fulfill their sexual urges they commit rape , torture , and murder ?

EOS remember , evidence of prior bad acts is inadmissible to show the defendant acted in accordance with a pattern of behavior under fre 404 ( b ) ( 1 ) . however , under fre 404 ( b ) ( 2 ) , it can be used to explain " motive , opportunity , intent , preparation , plan , knowledge , identity , absence of mistake , or lack of accident , " as long as the prosecutor provides notice of intent to use such evidence . so fre 404 ( b ) ( 2 ) explicitly states that we * can * use evidence of the eagle's prior acts of dropping a turtle on a rock to infer motive , assuming the eagle is a criminal defendant . if the eagle is a civil defendant , under fre 404 ( a ) ( 1 ) , we cannot use such evidence to establish that the eagle acted in accordance with this character trait . this is all under the united states federal rules of evidence . obviously if it's a state case , there would be slight differences , but you can assume it's mostly the same . however , aeschylus is greek , so you would need to use greek law . according to a doctoral thesis i found , character evidence was fairly widely used in the ancient athenian legal system . so we can assume that the eagle's prior acts could be used to show motive . but aeschylus died in gela , italy , so roman law under the 12 tables would apply , if my knowledge of that period is correct . from what i can gather from wikipedia , this was fairly similar in terms of the use of character evidence .

EOS if you're really curious , wikipedia has a pretty comprehensive [ list ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_serial_killers_by_number_of_victims ) of serial killers ranked by number of victims that includes dates of activity . the list includes people from all over the world , and most of the top spots are occupied by south / latin american killers , which is unfortunate because in many of those cases , the tallies are based on estimates and confessions of the killers themselves , and serial killers are prone to exaggerating their number of victims for whatever reason , so while it's certainly possible that many of the most prolific serial killers were latin american , shoddy investigations and tabulation methods mean that it'll remain hard to ascertain exact numbers for many of those cases . going by this list , gary ridgeway , the green river killer , was the most prolific american serial killer , who killed mostly prostitutes from the 80s til the late 90s . after him , well over half of the list's american members were homosexual killers . there's gacy , dahmer , dean corll , ted bundy ( though he wasn't gay ; he killed young women ) , wayne williams ( homosexual pedophile responsible for the atlanta child murders in which he raped and murdered male children ) , ronald dominique ( killed young boys , although he was active in the 90s through early 00s ) , patrick kearney ( raped and killed male hitchhikers aged 12-19 ) , william bonin ( raped and murdered young men ) , and on and on . now gay people , depending on which estimate you use , are probably 8-13 % of the population ; according to this list , gay men comprise well over 50 % ( and probably closer to 75 % ) of the most prolific american serial killers . further , of the guys i just listed , 90 % of their murders occurred between the years 1970 and 1990 ; the vast majority happened from 1971-1985 , and there is only 1 guy active past the year 2000 who made the list . this means , for whatever reason , american serial killings peaked in the 70s or early 80s , and since then serial killers have been relatively rare . it didn't * start * in the 70s - you can find people on the list active in the 50s & 60s - but for some reason the 70s were the peak of american serial killings , and most , as in over half , of those killers were gay . now , i don't know what accounts for this uptick . i don't know why it was seemingly relatively rare before the 70s and has been since . and maybe it's a total coincidence that the gay rights movement's main victories coincided with this decline in serial killing . but it is curious : why were so many of these killers gay ? was it a neurological thing ? a child abuse thing ? i don't think there's any way to conclusively prove my idea , but if we believe the things people like dahmer said , that he didn't want to kill , he just had to kill to get sexual satisfaction , then maybe it's not crazy to assume a relationship . there are no other crimes , that i know of , that gays commit at a higher rate than straight people . until the 60s , gay men customarily stayed in the closet , married women and never acted on their sexual desires . with the sexual revolution of the 60s , gay men would at least be aware that there were other gays out there , but most stayed in the closet or married women for social reasons . for some , the 1960s were the first time that the existence of gays was even acknowledged at all ; in the 50s , people just pretended they didn't exist . so at the very least , it is curious that the period between the first public acknowledgement of gays and claims for gay rights in the 60s , and the establishment of gay rights and social acceptance in the 00s , was marred by a rash of gay serial killers , at a rate vastly larger than their proportion of the population .	8-13 % ? gay and bisexuals in total are substantially less than 5 % of the population .

EOS i can't speak for the redwood forests because logging practices have changed much over the years and that wikipedia article doesn't say specifically what it means by " logged " . there was a time when we thought it was healthiest to clear-cut a forest , then terrace the hills to prevent erosion . now logging involves years of study and permit applications . in california i have heard it can take up to 20 years to be granted a permit to log an area ( was told this by someone who worked for the us forest service in the area ) . they go through the trees and select which trees may be cut and which trees must remain . the logging companies play along in this because it's good business to invest in the forests . the forest service plays along because selective thinning is the most efficient substitute for allowing forest fires to replant and clear undergrowth , ladder fuels , old growth , disease , etc . in forests that are not maintained by logging or regular burns , a forest fire will burn far to hot . it destroys all the trees and bakes the soil which takes decades to even begin to recover . so when they say 96 % has been logged , it does not necessarily mean that 96 % of the forests are gone . i would expect that a good chunk of those forests are healthy because of logging . but the wikipedia article doesn't seem to specify how responsibly the forests have been logged so we can't be certain without further information .	great reply . thank you for your contribution to the conversation . very insightful .

EOS here's a blog post he wrote after alexander mcqueen died , makes him seem more ' normal ' : " i ’ m on the plane listening to the college dropout . it brings back so many memories . when we made it i had all 6 parents , 4 grandparents and my mom and dad . now i have my dad and my grandfather . music is so nostalgic . every song i listen to brings me back to when i first played them for my mom , when i first played from for dame , when i first played them jay , when i first played them for kweli , when i first played them for my niggas back in chi , when the album first came out , when i first called ebro from hot 97 and begged him to play through the wire , when dj pharris blew me up in the chi . we used to be the niggas rocking polo shirts , louie back packs , paper denim jeans , and exclusive adidas from sporty la . we were the underdogs . i never feel like i ’ m not the underdog . i never felt completely comfortable . i ’ m tormented by the need to create . with the loss of mcqueen i feel like we lost one of those faces of modern creativity ’ s mount rushmore . there were times that the only thing that kept me on this earth was the need and responsibility to create . maybe mcqueen felt his job was done because his last collection was the greatest of the decade . we are all so hurt . i know we ’ re selfish because he brought us so much joy and inspiration . i know how it feels when the night demons come . we can ’ t let them control our hands and feet . sometimes when it hurts so bad we have to just lay in the bed . just lay in bed and don ’ t move please , i know how it feels . i wish mcqueen could have just been still . don ’ t let the psychiatrists give you their drugs because it slows down your wings . society and public opinion can beat the wings off of angels . when god sees they can ’ t take it anymore he brings them back home . during this new album process sometimes i turn the music up and drink and cry . when something sounds so amazing and ground breaking i ’ m reminded of why i live . i drink the pain of now 2 generations and breathe our melodies and messages . the music keeps us alive . i was blessed with the opportunity to bring my and others dreams to life . it ’ s like performing magic or something . it ’ s surreal . we bring the unrealistic to reality . “ go hard , go hard , go hard ” echoes in my dreams . when i wake up and brush my teeth and look in the mirror it ’ s like i see michael and my mom and malcolm . who ’ s that african in the background mom ? oh he created the original layouts for the pyramids but was written out the history books and his mtv award was given to “ aliens ” . there ’ s no such thing as fact anymore , only opinion . the closest thing we have to fact is “ common opinion ” . everything is an opinion . the way you dress is an expression of your opinion . your religious beliefs are your opinion . the music you turn up loud is your opinion . for most people it ’ s easier to just agree . for me the hardest thing is to ‘ just ’ agree and that is what sparks creativity , the feeling that something can be better , the feeling that something ’ s missing . the feeling that something ’ s needed . "	i feel like i understand kanye's creative process so much better with that last paragraph .

EOS it's interesting to me how amazon has struggled a lot more than netflix in producing high quality first party films / shows . i mean the production quality is just so much lower for a lot of amazon's stuff imho . not that it's all bad , just a bunch always feels less professional . like how netflix got house of cards , when amazon made alpha house .	but to be fair , amazon also has the man in the high castle , and that's just a plain masterpiece of a show .
