EOS there may actually be something to this idea . > in 2001 , vilayanur s . ramachandran and edward hubbard repeated köhler's experiment using the words " kiki " and " bouba " and asked american college undergraduates and tamil speakers in india " which of these shapes is bouba and which is kiki ? " in both groups , 95 % to 98 % selected the curvy shape as " bouba " and the jagged one as " kiki " , suggesting that the human brain somehow attaches abstract meanings to the shapes and sounds in a consistent way . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDxajXekbaM EOS kiki sounds like it would be sharp , so it makes sense to me .	kukri bulb both made up words are similar to well known words in english , that are commonly described with those traits . something to be said of what came first , the chicken or the egg in this situation .
