EOS i believe i have a decent claim at a erdős – bacon number of 7 , though it's admittedly a bit soft on both sides . erdős : in high school , my pre-calculus teacher helped me turn an extra-credit project i did into article form suitable to submit to this magazine that put a call out for student-authored articles . for the life of me i can't recall the name of the magazine , but it was one of those thin newsprint publications like [ games ] ( http://www.gamesmagazine-online.com/ ) that was aimed at middle - and high-school students . i don't think it was actually games magazine , but it could have been . she got her phd in mathematics at the university of texas back in the 60 ' s or 70 ' s , had worked in industry at places like [ vought ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought ) before becoming a university professor and finally a high-school teacher . she told me at the time that she had a erdős number of 3 , and explained what it meant . at the time i thought it was cool , but whatever . i was mostly interested in the extra credit for writing the paper , which was basically an illustrated guide to drawing a whole slew of regular polygons with a compass and ruler . i know it wasn't exactly a rigorous mathematical paper , but whatever . my teacher had an erdős number . i wish i had documented her chain to erdős , but i didn't really appreciate what it meant until much later . sadly , she died halfway through my senior year . bacon : when i was young , from a baby to about age 10 , i worked on the side as a model . i mostly appeared in your typical department store ads you find in the sunday newspaper . it's something my mother got me and both of my brothers into , though not in a pushy way or anything , and they put all the money we made into our own savings accounts for college . as soon as i expressed the fact that i didn't like it anymore , she told my agent i was done . anyway , i was in some tv commercials and movies too . the movie that had the biggest stars ( at the time - - this was the mid - 80 ' s ) was this really terrible made-for-tv movie starring [ donna mills ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005234/ ) and [ ken howard ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397432/ ) called [ he's not your son ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087394/ ) about two babies who were switched at birth in the hospital and grew up with the wrong families . i played one of the two kids during the 7-10 ages , though all my speaking parts were cut and i really only ended up in some time-lapse montages involving birthday parties and stuff . tl ;D r : i claim a rather soft erdős-bacon number of ( 4 + 3 )= 7 .	i think i was off-base with the games magazine comparison . it actually might have been [ this magazine ] ( http://teacher.scholastic.com/products/classmags/math.htm ) .

EOS yes it's good that art modell and family now pollute baltimore harbor rather than lake erie . but the browns never left cleveland . the players , staff , and equipment quit to baltimore , but the browns did not . the ravens were an expansion team ; the browns were a team on hiatus . that is the history as decided by the nfl and the courts . i lived in cleveland at the time of the move , and i've never seen anything like it . for the remaining home games after the move was announced , there was no advertising anywhere in municipal stadium . a team that drew 60,000 plus no matter how bad they were couldn't give away tickets to the game . every last piece of browns regalia disappeared from every restaurant , bar , corner shop , and public space in the city overnight . art modell has still not returned to cleveland , nor would he be welcome . but just to be clear on one point : art modell took his team to baltimore , but the browns never left cleveland .	amen , brotha . this post was written with tenacity .

EOS i agree . i graduated in 2008 from a college that pumped out a truck load of " software engineers , " about 90 % of which had zero social skills and didn't want to do anything but sit in a corner and be a programmer . the few of us who stood apart from the majority were all hired before we graduated . we're all in " engineering " positions , and i ended up consulting in the financial services industry . some of the remainder are still looking for work . and as for the difference between " programmer " and " software engineer , " imo it's the engineer who is asked to help analyze business rules , shape the requirements of the project , design and architect each layer of the system , and implement the system with the tools best fit for the job . the programmer is asked only to do that which the title implies - - program . personally i prefer to call it " software development " so that i don't have to toss the two titles around . i've often represented the company i work for at career fairs around the state . time and time again the " computer science , " " management information systems , " or " programming " majors we choose to pursue can't make it through a simple phone screen - - they choke up on basic software concepts that the " software engineering " majors barely even blink at . so that's my $ 0.02 . sorry if it sounded a bit egotistical , it was not my intent . i simply wanted to share my observations in my limited experience as a software engineer . also , i love the analogy to music . * * tl ;D r * * schools forget about teaching students social skills . i love the music analogy .	no offense , but i can tell you graduated in 2008 .

EOS what's illogical about it ? i'm pointing out that there's at least one example of a smart , technological savvy person who didn't think working at microsoft was the right decision . and judging by valve's success , i think he was right .

EOS versatile actors aren't ' talented ' by definition . you can have an actor fill out different roles with mediocre performance in each . EOS filling out different roles and being versatile arent the same thing . yes , any up and coming actor can fill an assortment of bit parts , but being truly versatile requires convincingly bringing a wide varieity of unique characters to life , like mr oldman does .	no , what i'm saying is that you can fit a role perfectly without having acted out that role perfectly . a good analogy would be the jack-of-all-trades : capable of a lot of stuff , but not too good in each .

EOS i live near a nuclear power plant , and i wish more people realized this . most think that they will see a mushroom cloud appear if something goes wrong - _ - EOS well actually you do get a slightly higher amount of radiation exposure than someone not living next to one but it's an extra 0.04 % more than the standard background radiation or something . nuclear plants do emit tiny bit of radiation into the atmosphere but again its ridiculously negligible .	there have been studies that show that small levels of radiation above the background level can actually be good for people . - - citation needed

EOS the title is misleading . the chance of infection goes up exponentially when someone has another sti also , including hpv which is extremely common . also hiv infection increases rates of contracting other stis . most people who get hiv get it when either they or their partner are co-infected with something else . there is not sufficient data to compile statistics on infection rates with every other infection because there are too many and most disease agents come in different strains . since it most stis have periods of non symptomatic latency it is impossible to determine who is infected without lab testing . the chances of hiv passing from an hiv carrier with no other stis to a person with no stis is truly low , so monogamous serodiscordant couples can have sex quite safely . but if one has sex with someone who has a latent sti and recently got hiv and is in the acute infection stage , then hiv transmission is more likely than not to occur .	very interesting , thanks .

EOS speaking of calculations ( just in case you're interested ) ... * * i have absolutely no medical knowledge on this topic * * ( please pretty please don't sue me ) , but i * do * have some statistical knowledge , so if i had to guess , it would be something like : * p = original probability of infection . * p ' = probability of infection given the other person also has disease xyz . * k = how much xyz affects the likelihood of infection . this is a number between 0 and positive infinity : 0 makes sex completely safe , 1 means no effect , and bigger than 1 means sex is riskier . bigger = riskier . * p ' = 1 - ( 1 - p ) ^ k one neat thing about this setup is that you can multiply different k values together to get the total risk . if you play stragegy games , think of it as hiv's attack modifier . here's * * an example with * made-up numbers * * * : * start off at k = 1 . * suppose you're a guy . then p = 0.0005 ( probability when condoms are not used ) . * girl has cuts or sores . multiply k by 5 to get k = 5 . * girl has two additional diseases which increase risk . multiply k by 4 to get k = 20 , and again to get k = 80 . this is an * * exponential part * * , because k gets multiplied by 4 ^ n , where n is the number of diseases you have . again , fake numbers ( it might not be 4 ) but you get the idea . * you sleep with the girl twice , so multiply k by 2 to get k = 160 . * you use a condom both times , which * decreases * risk of infection . multiply k by 0.15 to get k = 24 . now we can calculate p ' = 1 - ( 1 - 0.0005 ) ^ 24 = approximately 0.0119 , which means you've gone from a 0.05 % chance to a 1 % chance of infection . 1 % isn't * huge * , but still , that's bigger than wikipedia initially suggested . note also that the number of times you put yourself at risk matters : if you slept with the girl 12 times ( or 2 girls 6 times , or 3 girls 4 times ... ) , then p ' = 0.0695 = 7 % . this has the potential to be one seriously messed up computer game .	bigger is definitely riskier . make sure you use enough lube .

EOS my english is not good enough to understand what happened with the alzheimer . EOS her husband suffered the horrible disease call alzheimer's disease which basically ruins the sufferer's brain , most notably memory . instead of being jealous about her husband's mistress , she was happy that he could enjoy something in life . she reasoned that love between two individuals can be so complex to allow this . i hope that helped .	thanks dude , i reread that a lot but didn't get the point . you explained it nicely . it feels a bit like when my ex gf left me for some other guy i hoped she was lucky with him , because i still loved her and i wanted her to be happy .

EOS the question becomes where do you draw the line ? EOS possibly when it becomes an actual problem , rather than a hypothetical . why is it ok to bring potentially dangerous items like steel pens into the legislature ? because in reality , that's never a problem . the same logic should apply . there is nobody threatening the quebec legislature with tiny ceremonial knives , so tiny ceremonial knives should not be banned there . EOS just because they call it a ceremonial dagger doesn't change the fact that they are still daggers . daggers are weapons and weapons are not allowed in the legislature . i don't think just because there is religious symbolism behind it , they should be exempt from the law .	assuming that it is about as dull as a butter knife , as most kirpans are , then it has the form of a dagger , but not the commonly defined function of a dagger . which do we care about ?

EOS right . in high school my physics teacher challenged us to determine how many times we had to shuffle a deck of cards to impart entropy . being a computer geek , i wrote a little shuffling routine to simulate the shuffling of a deck of cards . it went something like this : def shuffle ( deck ): split_index = int ( len ( deck ) * ( random ( ) / 10.0 + . 45 ) ) input_deck = [ deck [: split_index ] , deck [ split_index :] ] output_deck = [ ] deck_index = 0 while len ( input_deck [ 0 ] ) > 0 or len ( input_deck [ 1 ] ) > 0 : if random ( ) < 0.75 : deck_index = ( deck_index + 1 ) % 2 try : output_deck . append ( input_deck [ deck_index ] . pop ( ) ) except indexerror : output_deck . extend ( input_deck [ ( deck_index + 1 ) % 2 ] ) break return output_deck explanation : start by splitting the deck somewhere near the middle . when shuffling , you tend to take a few cards from one deck then a few cards from the other deck , so i simulated this by giving a 75 % chance of taking each card from the same deck as the last card . when one deck is empty , the remaining cards from the other deck are stuck at the bottom of the stack . i dusted off this code to check this claim , and came up with the following : deck_set = set ( ) new_deck = shuffle ( range ( 52 ) ) while str ( new_deck ) not in deck_set : deck_set . add ( str ( new_deck ) ) new_deck = shuffle ( range ( 52 ) ) this creates a set , shuffles a fresh deck ( the numbers 0-51 in order ) , and adds it to the set . i got 310,169 different decks before i ran across a duplicate . most decks start in the same order , so there's a reasonably high chance that the first time you shuffle a deck you'll get something someone has gotten before . once you've shuffled it a couple of times , the chances of coming up with a deck someone has already seen is much lower . if i felt like it , i could come up with the probability of coming up with the same deck twice based on the assumptions above , but i think this has already gone on a little too long .	thanks ! that's a handy simulator .

EOS somebody else's link : http://magazine.ucla.edu/features/smart_set/ > as is the case for many highly motivated students , solid academic planning was tops on franco's initial list of needs . one example : * though the school has a 19 - unit-per-quarter limit * ( anything above that must be approved by academic advising ) , " i wanted to take more classes than that , " franco says . " i wasn't going back to school just to get by with a little amount of work . " > " more classes , " is , perhaps , an understatement : during his time at ucla , in fact , franco's course load ranged from 20 to 62 credits per quarter , a tremendous amount in itself , and through much of which he continued to work on movies . ( he also managed to maintain a gpa above 3.5 . ) > " [ james ' ] was truly just a thirst for knowledge , a sense that ' i've waited this long , i'm going to take advantage of everything , i don't want to miss anything , ' " hein-unruh recalls . art > a thirst for knowledge is , not surprisingly , not unusual among high-achievers . but just because a top-tier bruin undergrad expresses genuine passion , he or she doesn't have course-credit carte blanche . as hein-unruh reminds , the unit cap is put in place in part to ensure that resources are available for all students to meet their academic goals and degree requirements . > " there's clearly not one easy answer , " she says . " there are a lot of things to take into consideration : what's your motivation ? is this something you can be successful at ? are there enough hours in the day ? " > hein-unruh notes that in her typical consideration process , she also makes sure that extra-unit requests include a range of academic programs : classes , independent studies , travel abroad programs . " it's easier often for a student to be successful in a higher number of units if there's some variation , " she explains . " if [ franco ] had been in seven upper-division english courses , that would not have been workable . " > though franco acknowledges his overwhelming course loads left him unable to get much sleep or enjoy any kind of social life — " you can't even say hello to anybody , " he half-jokes — in the end , hein-unruh says , his motivation won her over . " he had very clear , legitimate academic goals that he was trying to meet , " he says . > " in penny's defense , " franco adds , " it took a couple of weeks [ to persuade her ] . i really had to beg her and convince her that i could really handle the workload . " there was only one quarter ( presumably ) that he took 62 credits , but he really did it . with the permission of the university .	the question is what " did it " means . there's some speculation that he had a significant amount of help , some of it bordering on cheating .

EOS i had a friend that did . lot's of stammering and excuse making . but she mostly fell back on that if captured a woman soldier could be raped . no shit , so can a male soldier . much less likely but still possible . but my friend retorted that women provoke more emotion and would have a better chance of being ransomed back and not tortured slowly to death . EOS well , it is hard to advocate for rape . i guess that would be the only real way to respond ... EOS > well , it is hard to advocate for rape . that's not the point . men * and * women can be raped . but by using rape as an excuse to keep * * only * * women out of the military , she is suggesting that a male being raped is somehow less severe than a woman being raped . we can only accept her reasoning if we accept that conclusion , probability be damned .	oh , don't get me wrong . i don't think its a good argument that would sway me . i am just saying that the rape angle was better than the ones i could come up with .
