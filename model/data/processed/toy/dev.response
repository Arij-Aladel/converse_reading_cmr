i thought it was going to be that stupid peyton manning face . thank you for actually being a little clever .
i'm really surprised he's a republican . i'm not from the us and i really thought only democrats were elected in cali , how he managed that ?
or maybe california in general just isn't so great as it appears on the surface and the populace has unreasonable demands for what their governor can reasonably accomplish .
how dare he request verification or an expansion to the information you provided . does he not know who you are and how important your time is ?

we can't see the monetary value it provides by itself , but as a whole . netflix and amazon have different value propositions and by adding to its library of
more like a fantasy of future media . what will actually happen is that all the other companies die out , leaving us with two or three monopolising companies ,
but to be fair , amazon also has the man in the high castle , and that's just a plain masterpiece of a show .
those shows are all terrible though . but i also love them .
i think apple tv uses rotten tomatoes , so they might have some deal with apple .
it happens even with animals . there are polar-grizzly bear hybrids in the wild .

all the people demanding reparations have a legitimate claim on living brits . this is actually pretty funny .
i don't know what taxes you think <NUM> - year-olds are paying ...
slaves weren't exclusively black or portrayed as animals for generations either , which helped for a smoother transition
i don't know exactly how slavery was in britain but in some countries even commom people would have one or two slaves .
lincoln proposed to buy out the slaves more than once . if i remember right it never worked because of the general approach of defeating an idea - paying is
