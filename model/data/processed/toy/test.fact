" </p> <p> </p> <p> the direct economic impact of declining mexican tourists could be staggering for the united states . </p> <p> mexican sentiment for the u . s . has been lagging since the primary elections when then-candidate donald trump claimed that mexican immigrants were rapists and drug dealers . there were reports of trump piñatas , angry newspaper op-eds and anti-trump murals . during the presidential debates , mexicans held drinking games , knocking one back every time their country was mentioned . </p> <p> at the same time , canada has made it easier than ever to visit . in june <NUM> , canadian prime minister justin trudeau announced visa-free travel for mexicans . since the policy was first announced , mexican tourism to canada has been skyrocketing , increasing <NUM> % , according to forwardkeys , a travel trend predicting firm . </p> <p> when visa-free travel was enacted in december , mexican visitors increased <NUM> % , a " dramatic response " that fowardkeys attributes to the changes in the law . at the same time , the firm says that bookings to the u . s . have been down <NUM> % , despite the dollar weakening against the mexican peso , which usually drives tourism . overall , the long-term economic impact could be staggering . </p> <p> mexico is america's second-largest inbound tourism market , accounting for some <NUM> million visits in <NUM> . just this year , experts predict <NUM> % less visits from mexico , totaling a $ <NUM> billion loss in direct economic spending by <NUM> , according to tourism economics , a research firm . </p>

<title> the history of gifs </title> <p> </p> <p> gifs have flashed across many a webpage , flickered within millions of myspace profiles and glittered among innumerable tumblrs . you've spotted them in animated advertising , email signatures , web forums and social avatars . indeed , if i had to repurpose the acronym for " gif " it would be " great internet fun . " </p> <p> in fact , " gif " stands for " graphics interchange format , " a mature name for an image format just coming of age in the digital space . specifically , steve wilhite of compuserve debuted the gif in june <NUM> . the gif improved on black and white image transfers with <NUM> colors , while still retaining a compressed format that slow modems could load easily . using the graphics control extension , the gif achieved animation via timed delays . </p> <p> however , in its infancy the gif met controversy . allegedly unbeknownst to compuserve at the time , the compression technique was patented in <NUM> by unisys . the two companies engaged in a copyright disagreement that carried into <NUM> , whereupon unisys announced it would allow commercial properties to license the format for a small fee . in response to the disagreement , many developers vowed to boycott the gif , preferring the new png format , a single-image , patent-free alternative to the gif . </p> <p> but the gif would not be stymied . early world wide web users adopted the gif when designing their webpages — and for a variety of reasons . some introduced these animated placeholders while constructing their web properties , in the form of blinking construction signs and spinning hard hats . others preferred a flashy banner at the top of their pages — we remember flames , prowling dinosaurs and rolling eyeballs . </p> <p> from its early days , the gif had an inherent element of fun . remember the dancing banana ? well , it was inspired by a flash music video created for the buckwheat boyz's song " peanut butter jelly time . " soon , the internet appropriated the banana gif as its own . some forums replaced the code : banana : with the groovy dancing gif . and of course family guy couldn't stay mum , either . </p> <p> regardless of the specific animation , web designers and engineers trusted the gif's compressed file size to load on early <NUM>k modems and outdated web browsers . on early webpages , the average two-minute youtube embed would have required about <NUM> minutes of buffering . so instead , people rocked the eyeballs and dinosaurs . </p> <p> as the creator of the gif , wilhite reportedly had something to say about its pronunciation , too . many assume " gif " is pronounced with a hard " g , " in accordance with the pronunciation of the first word in " <TRNC>

<title> imperial rescript on education making slow , contentious comeback | the japan times </title> <p> <NUM> </p> <p> p / sunny </p> <p> staff writer </p> <p> once declared incompatible with japan ’ s postwar transformation into a democracy , a <NUM>th - century imperial edict on patriotism is slowly making its way back into the nation ’ s education . spearheading its resurgence is none other than the government of prime minister shinzo abe . </p> <p> last month , abe ’ s cabinet approved an unprecedented statement declaring that the edict can be used as teaching material in schools , leaving the impression the government is endorsing the prewar document that , among other things , dictates unquestioning devotion to the emperor . </p> <p> “ use of the imperial rescript on education as teaching material cannot be denied , ” as long as its usage does not violate the constitution and the fundamental law of education , the cabinet said in a statement on march <NUM> . </p> <p> the statement added , however , that it is inappropriate to treat the rescript as if it were the only fundamental value underpinning the nation ’ s educational system , apparently emphasizing a difference from its holy status before and during the war . </p> <p> nonetheless , “ the cabinet ’ s approval can be interpreted as an official endorsement of the imperial rescript , ” said teruhisa horio , a professor emeritus of education studies at the university of tokyo . </p> <p> “ it could prompt some educators and textbook publishers to recast the document in a positive light . ” </p> <p> the edict was issued by emperor meiji in <NUM> when japan — in the grip of its rapid shift into modernization — was searching for a moral backbone that could serve as the japanese equivalent of teachings under christianity in the west , according to horio . </p> <p> drafted by statesman kowashi inoue , the edict fundamentally positions the emperor over the people , or his “ subjects , ” and touts a gamut of ethical values from filial piety to solidarity between siblings and loyal friendships to academic diligence . </p>

<title> it looks like ' star wars : battlefront ii ' will ditch the season pass </title> <p> star wars : battlefront ii ' s creative director confirmed something we'd been hoping for in an interview before today's announcement : there's no season pass for the game this time around . </p> <p> assuming things stay that way — and there's kinda-maybe-possibly a chance that they won't , as you'll soon read — it suggests that star wars : battlefront ii is coming together with an eye toward keeping the community whole long after the game is released . </p> <p> that was a big problem with the first battlefront from dice , released in <NUM> . the multiplayer-only game felt sparse at its $ <NUM> launch price , but it slowly evolved over four post-release map packs , each priced at $ <NUM> . a full year after its release , battlefront finally felt complete . </p> <p> see also : these ' star wars : the last jedi ' poster spoofs are hilarious </p> <p> unfortunately for players that stuck around , the economics of post-release downloadable content created a problem . as time went on and fewer returned for the new content drops , a shrinking number of people had access to absolutely everything . that , in turn , made it more difficult to find matches or even play with friends who hadn't kept on top of add-ons . </p> <p> while the details of star wars : battlefront ii ' s post-release life remain vague , we can confirm one major change : the season pass — which amounts to a discounted dlc pre-purchase — is no more . </p> <p> bernd diemer , dice's battlefront ii creative director , confirmed it outright in a chat ahead of the game's star wars celebration <NUM> reveal : " we don't have a season pass .

<title> escalator </title> <p> an escalator is a type of vertical transportation in the form of a moving staircase which carries people between floors of a building . it consists of a motor - driven chain of individually linked steps on a track which cycle on a pair of tracks which keep them horizontal . </p> <p> escalators are used around the world in places where elevators would be impractical . principal areas of usage include department stores , shopping malls , airports , transit systems , convention centers , hotels , arenas , stadiums and public buildings . </p> <p> escalators have the capacity to move large numbers of people . they can be placed in the same physical space as a staircase . they have no waiting interval . they can be used to guide people toward main exits or special exhibits . they may be weatherproofed for outdoor use . a nonfunctional escalator can function as a normal staircase , whereas many other methods of transport become useless when they break down or lose power . </p> <p> escalators typically rise at an angle of about <NUM> degrees from the ground . [ <NUM> ] they move at <NUM> – <NUM> metres per second and may traverse vertical distances in excess of <NUM> metres . most modern escalators have single-piece aluminum or stainless steel steps that move on a system of tracks in a continuous loop . </p> <p> escalators are typically configured in one of three ways : parallel , multiple parallel , or crisscross . [ <NUM> ] </p> <p> most countries require escalators to have moving handrails that keep pace with the movement of the steps as a safety measure . this helps riders steady themselves , especially when stepping onto the moving stairs . occasionally , a handrail moves at a slightly different speed from the steps , causing it to " creep " slowly forward or backward relative to the steps . slippage and normal wear can causes such losses of synchronicity . [ <NUM> ] </p> <p> the direction of escalator movement can be permanently set , controlled manually depending on the predominant flow of the crowd , or controlled automatically . in some setups , the direction is controlled by whoever arrives first . [ citation needed ] </p> <p> design factors include physical requirements , location , traffic patterns , safety considerations and aesthetics . physical factors such as the distance to be spanned determine the length and pitch of the escalator , while factors such as the infrastructure's ability to provide support and power must be considered . how upward and downward traffic is separated and load / unload areas are other important considerations . </p> <p> temporal traffic patterns must be anticipated . some escalators need only to move people from one floor to another , but others may have specific requirements , such as funneling visitors towards exits or exhibits . the visibility and accessibility of <TRNC>

<title> nintendo's simple brilliance in discontinuing the nes classic edition </title> <p> nes classic edition </p> <p> when the nes classic edition was announced last year i was quick to call it out as a money grab . now has announced that it will be discontinuing the nes classic edition and this move has struck some as being completely bizarre , perplexing and something about the mcrib . contrary to that line of thinking , i think ending the production of the nes classic edition highlights the genius of nintendo . </p> <p> nintendo had always said it planned on ending the nes classic after a limited run . this makes sense if you put the thing in context . it's a collectable , not a gaming system . it's like one of those silly funko pop figures that somehow keep reproducing on my bookshelf . fanboys hate it when i say this , but original nintendo games are great nostalgia , but are you really spending hours playing them ? when you have a choice between overwatch or kirby's adventure what are you going to play ? zelda : breath of <TRNC> <p> the nes classic is something , at this point , to be collected and look neat on your entertainment center above the records you never listen to either . if you want to play original nintendo cartridges you might pick up something like the analogue nt mini but even that just enables the collector mentality by giving purpose and reason to scooping up classic nintendo cartridges at garage sales and estate auctions . the collectible status of the nes classic was proven by simple economics . it continuously maintained a ' rare ' status , therefore creating insurmountable demand <TRNC> <p> </p> <p> also see : <NUM> games the nintendo switch needs before i'll consider buying it </p> <p> demand should never meet supply if you want to keep people clamoring for your product . economics <NUM> . create hype by never having enough . nintendo has done a pretty good job in the past of creating a fervor of demand for its products upon release due to controlling the supply chain . kind of like when mountain dew used to only have that orange flavor out during the summer back when i drank soda . while you can't buy the nes classic by the case and hoard in a walk-in cooler , you can try your hand <TRNC> <p> the reasoning here , controlling supply and therefore demand , seems obvious to me . nintendo came up with a pretty brilliant marketing plan for the switch by releasing the nes classic edition last year . the nes classic edition was foreplay for the switch in that it brought nintendo the brand into the front of our minds and wallets . it opened up our nostalgia veins and kept us bleeding right up until the switch was released . </p> <p> from summer last year to <TRNC>

[ <NUM> ] only foundations and sculptural fragments of the latest of the temples at the site remain . </p> <p> the first sanctuary antedated the ionic immigration by many years , and dates to the bronze age . callimachus , in his hymn to artemis , attributed it to the amazons . in the <NUM>th century bc , the old temple was destroyed by a flood . its reconstruction began around <NUM> bc , under the cretan architect chersiphron and his son metagenes , at the expense of croesus of lydia : the project took <NUM> years to complete . the temple was destroyed in <NUM> bc by herostratus in an act of arson and was again rebuilt , <TRNC> <p> antipater of sidon , who compiled the list of the seven wonders , describes the finished temple : </p> <p> i have set eyes on the wall of lofty babylon on which is a road for chariots , and the statue of zeus by the alpheus , and the hanging gardens , and the colossus of the sun , and the huge labour of the high pyramids , and the vast tomb of mausolus ; but when i saw the house of artemis that mounted to the clouds , those other marvels lost their brilliancy , and i said , " lo , apart from olympus , the sun never looked on aught so grand " .

[ <NUM> ] he said that the pre-ionic inhabitants of the city were leleges and lydians . callimachus , in his hymn to artemis attributed the earliest temenos at ephesus to the amazons , whose worship he imagined already centered upon an image of artemis , their matron goddess . pausanias says that pindar believed the temple's founding amazons to have <TRNC> <p> modern archaeology cannot confirm callimachus's amazons , but pausanias's account of the site's antiquity seems well-founded . <TRNC>

<title> mitch trubisky still a serious candidate for browns at no . <NUM> , sources say | cleveland.com </title> <p> gallery : mitch trubisky after pro day </p> <p> by mary kay cabot , cleveland.com </p> <p> cleveland , ohio - - mitch trubisky is still under serious consideration by the browns at no . <NUM> , league sources tell cleveland.com . </p> <p> despite that browns head of football operations sashi brown gave strong vibes during his pre-draft press conference wednesday that the browns have zeroed in on myles garrett , they're still strongly considering taking trubisky there , sources say . </p> <p> the feeling on the part of the front office , sources say , is that the browns are ready to draft their quarterback of the future and might not want to risk losing him if they try to trade up or hope he falls to them at no . <NUM> . </p> <p> sources have told cleveland.com that the <NUM>ers also like trubisky and might take him at no . <NUM> . " don't be surprised , ' ' said one . </p> <p> if that's the case , the browns would likely turn to deshaun watson or patrick mahomes . but if they believe that trubisky can be their franchise quarterback , and some in the organization apparently do , they might want to pull the trigger at no . <NUM> . </p> <p> as reported here last week , hue jackson is firmly in the myles garrett camp at no . <NUM> , and so is new defensive coordinator gregg williams . the coaches want a surefire gamechanger who can help them win right away , and jackson said as much at the nfl owners meetings last month . trubisky , while he shows promise , will need time after starting only <NUM> games at north carolina . </p> <p> but the browns front office , led by brown and chief strategy officer paul depodesta , are taking some of their cues from former cowboys coach jimmy johnson , who turned his team around with troy aikman , the no . <NUM> pick in <NUM> . the cowboys went <NUM><NUM> that year , but jumped to <NUM><NUM> in <NUM> and <NUM><NUM> and a playoff berth in <NUM> . over the next four seasons , they won three super bowls , and aikman established himself as a hall of fame quarterback . </p> <p> the thinking in the front office is that the browns traded down last year - - away from potential franchise quarterback carson wentz at no . <NUM> - - and stockpiled high picks with which to rebuild the team . they also positioned themselves to draft their franchise quarterback this year , and are now possibly poised to do it . </p>

<title> suppletion </title> <p> in linguistics and etymology , suppletion is traditionally understood as the use of one word as the inflected form of another word when the two words are not cognate . for those learning a language , suppletive forms will be seen as " irregular " or even " highly irregular " . the term " suppletion " implies that a gap in the paradigm was filled by a form " supplied " by a different paradigm . instances of suppletion are overwhelmingly restricted to the most commonly used lexical items in a language . </p> <h<NUM>> <anchor> examples </anchor> </h<NUM>> <p> suppletion exists in more than <NUM> languages around the world .

<title> hazard symbol </title> <p> hazard symbols or warning symbols are recognisable symbols designed to warn about hazardous materials , locations , or objects , including electric currents , poisons , and radioactivity . the use of hazard symbols is often regulated by law and directed by standards organisations . hazard symbols may appear with different colors , backgrounds , borders and supplemental information in order to specify the type of hazard . warning symbols are used in many places in lieu of or addition to written warnings as they are quickly recognized and more universally understood . </p> <p> on roadside warning signs , an exclamation mark is often used to draw attention to a generic warning of danger , hazards , and the unexpected . in europe , this type of sign is used if there are no more-specific signs to denote a particular hazard . [ <NUM> ] when used for traffic signs , it is accompanied by a supplementary sign describing the hazard , usually mounted under the exclamation mark . </p> <p> this symbol has also been more widely adopted for generic use in many other contexts not associated with road traffic . it often appears on hazardous equipment or in instruction manuals to draw attention to a precaution , when a more-specific warning symbol is not available . </p> <p> the skull-and-crossbones symbol , consisting of a human skull and two bones crossed together behind the skull , is today generally used as a warning of danger , particularly in regard to poisonous substances . </p> <p> the symbol , or some variation thereof , specifically with the bones below the skull , was also featured on the jolly roger , the traditional flag of european and american seagoing pirates . it is also part of the canadian whmis home symbols placed on containers to warn that the contents are poisonous . </p> <p> in the united states , due to concerns that the skull-and-crossbones symbol's association with pirates might encourage children to play with toxic materials , the mr . yuk symbol is also used to denote poison . </p> <p> the international radiation symbol first appeared in <NUM> , at the university of california , berkeley radiation laboratory . [ <NUM> ] at the time , it was rendered as magenta , and was set on a blue background . the modern version used in the us is magenta against a yellow background , and it is drawn with a central circle of radius r , an internal radius of <NUM> r and an external radius of <NUM> r for the blades , which are separated from each other by <NUM> ° . the trefoil is black in the <TRNC> <p> the sign is commonly referred to as a radioactivity warning sign , but it is actually a warning sign of ionizing radiation . ionizing radiation is a much broader category than radioactivity alone , as many non-radioactive sources also emit potentially <TRNC>
